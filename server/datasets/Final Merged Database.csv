httpsblogmorphiseccomhow-ai-enabled-capabilities-are-transforming-cybersecurity,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized nearly every sector, and cybersecurity is no exception. As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, AI is transforming how both vendors and defenders approach these evolving challenges. I recently joined Chief Technology Officer and AI visionary Benjamin Bohman for an episode of AI Insights: The Executive Brief where we covered the profound impact of AI on cybersecurity, including its role in combating alert fatigue, streamlining behavioral analytics, and shaping future defense mechanisms.

The Rise of AI in Cybersecurity

The rise of AI in cybersecurity isn’t a recent phenomenon. Behavioral analytics, a core AI capability, has been evolving since 2012. Initially, AI's role focused on analyzing user behavior to detect anomalies, such as unusual login patterns or data transfers. Over the years, this has expanded into machine learning and deep learning applications that are far more complex, using vast datasets to predict potential threats and automate defenses.

But what’s really driving the conversation today is how rapidly AI is evolving. More than 80% of cybersecurity vendors are now integrating AI into their systems, building out different models and leveraging tools like generative AI and OpenAI. These innovations help companies stay ahead of the ever-growing cyber threat landscape.

AI vs. AI: The Cybersecurity Arms Race

The current cybersecurity environment can be described as ""Machine vs. Machine."" Cybersecurity vendors are deploying AI-enabled defenses, but cybercriminals are equally quick to embrace AI-driven attacks. This dynamic has turned the traditional “cat and mouse” game between attackers and defenders into an AI arms race.

Both sides are leveraging AI to automate processes. Defenders use AI for threat detection, while attackers are developing automated tools to breach defenses. The more sophisticated these systems become, the more critical it is to evolve detection and defense mechanisms. In this high-speed AI-fueled battle, cybersecurity vendors are constantly refining their capabilities to stay one step ahead. The challenge is to deploy AI models that are resilient and less susceptible to being compromised by adversaries.

AI's Achilles Heel: Lack of Guardrails

While AI offers enormous potential, it’s not without its risks. As companies increasingly rely on AI, one significant concern is the lack of ""guardrails""—or safeguards—built into these systems. Without proper oversight, AI can lead companies into dangerous territory. We’re moving at breakneck speeds with AI, likened to “driving 200 mph with no seatbelts or guardrails.”

AI models, while highly efficient, are not foolproof. They can be “poisoned” by attackers who trick them into making incorrect decisions, or they can fail to detect novel threats. As most cybersecurity vendors invest in AI, the rush to implement new technologies often prioritizes profit over safety, increasing the likelihood of vulnerabilities.

Defense in Depth: Beyond AI

While AI plays a critical role in modern cybersecurity, it is not a complete solution. AI-based models can only do so much, and as these systems evolve, defenders need strategies that can adapt when AI systems fall short. This is where approaches like Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) come into play.

AMTD essentially ""morphs"" the attack surface, creating an ever-shifting environment that makes it harder for attackers to gain a foothold. Think of it as a kaleidoscope or funhouse mirror—by constantly changing the landscape, AMTD provides an additional layer of defense that complements traditional AI-based detection models.

A Practical Layer of Protection

The combination of AI and additional layers of defense is crucial as organizations increasingly turn to platformization—standardizing their cybersecurity tools on platforms like Microsoft. With Microsoft’s E5 licensing, for example, companies can streamline their cybersecurity operations, integrating AI and analytics directly into their operating systems.

However, even with these “easy button” solutions, there is still a need for strategies that go beyond standard defenses to mitigate the risks of AI failure.

By adopting AMTD and other adaptive mechanisms, companies can build a robust security posture that doesn’t rely solely on AI but uses it as part of a larger, multi-layered strategy.

46. Lateral movement occurs when attackers navigate within a compromised network, often detectable through unusual access patterns or privilege escalations.  
47. Regular auditing of log files helps identify anomalies, unauthorized access, and potential breaches by analyzing recorded events.  
48. A honeypot is a decoy system or resource designed to attract cyber attackers, allowing organizations to detect, analyze, and learn from their methods. It helps divert malicious activity from valuable assets and provides insights into potential threats.
49. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but less secure if the key is compromised. Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys, offering stronger security as only the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the public key.
50. In a MITM attack, an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker can capture sensitive data like passwords or inject malicious content into the communication.
51. A vulnerability scan is an automated process that identifies known security weaknesses in a system, such as unpatched software or misconfigurations. A penetration test, however, involves simulated attacks by ethical hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security measures.
52. Organizations can protect data from insider threats by implementing strict access controls, regularly monitoring user activity, training employees on security practices, and using data loss prevention (DLP) tools to detect and block suspicious behavior.
53. The primary challenges in attributing cyberattacks to specific perpetrators include the use of anonymizing technologies, such as VPNs and proxies, and the fact that cybercriminals often operate from different countries with differing legal frameworks. Additionally, attackers use sophisticated methods to hide their tracks, and in some cases, they may impersonate other actors or use hacked third-party infrastructure to avoid detection.
54. Fast flux and bulletproof servers make it difficult for investigators to track and shut down malicious actors. Fast flux is a technique where the attacker frequently changes the IP addresses associated with a domain, making it hard to pinpoint the server location. Bulletproof servers are often hosted in countries with lax enforcement of cybercrime laws, which allows cybercriminals to continue operations with little interference from law enforcement.
55. Government agencies play a vital role in enhancing national cybersecurity resilience by establishing regulatory frameworks, promoting information sharing, providing resources for threat detection and response, and investing in national infrastructure protection. Agencies like the U.S. Cyber Command and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) also help coordinate responses to major cyber incidents and develop international cybersecurity norms.
56. The shortage of cybersecurity professionals is a critical issue because it leaves organizations vulnerable to cyber threats due to a lack of expertise in detecting, preventing, and mitigating attacks. As cyber threats evolve in complexity, the demand for skilled professionals, such as penetration testers, incident responders, and threat analysts, increases, outpacing the supply of qualified candidates.
57. The key components of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) include the requirement for organizations to obtain explicit consent from individuals for data processing, the right to access and erase personal data, and the need to ensure data protection by design and by default. The regulation also mandates the appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in certain organizations and imposes severe penalties for non-compliance, impacting any entity that processes personal data of EU residents.",
httpsgridinsoftcomadware,"Adware is part of software that makes money for its creators by bombarding you with ads. Adware sneaks onto computer unnoticed, sometimes bundled with free software or via torrents. Once installed, it floods computer screen with ads. These can be annoying popups, intrusive banners, or intext links that appear out of context. You may be interested in taking a look at our other antivirus tools Trojan Killer, and Online Virus Scanner. September , Adware is a type of unwanted software designed to forcefully display advertisements. To achieve this, the program makes various alterations to your system, primarily targeting web browsers and networking settings. Adware installs itself onto your PC, hoping you'll accidentally or not click on an advert it displays. The main reason why adware exists is to make money but not for you. Adware creators and distributing vendors make money from third parties via either Adware can also track your search and browsing history to display ads that are more relevant to you. Once the adware developer has your location and browser history, they can make an additional profit by selling your information to third parties. Still, relevant and safe advertisements are not the main concern of adware masters. Developers who manage adware make their money like any other advertisers. Two main differences between adware distributors and legit promoters are the people who order these ads and how those banners are paid. Usually, promoters are paid for each click on their advertisement. Meanwhile, fraudsters take contracts for pay per view ads. The price for each visitor is minimal, but when you show it forcibly to hundreds or even thousands victims, there is nothing complicated in making a lot of money. The difference in a character is much easier to understand. Will the legit company advertise itself with illegal marketing tricks Likely no. Hence, all ads adware forces you to see has malicious content to certain extent. Usually, those contents are links that redirect you to unknown and likely unwanted sites. In some cases, the downloading may start after clicking those ads. And only fraudsters know what the program is downloading. You may get a coin miner, another adware, a browser hijacker, the list goes on and on. Regardless of the exact type of malware, it is always an unwanted consequence. Adware comes in different forms. Here are some common types Some types of adware are illegal in the U.S. Lets look more closely at state and federal laws. Many U.S. states have laws against spyware, which includes certain kinds of adware. For example, California's Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act says that a person or business cannot knowingly install software on someone's computer without permission. That in fact covers all the unwanted programs, with ad supported ones among them. Under federal law, causing damage to or more computers within a year, resulting in losses of , or more, is a felony. Adware can cause such damage as the result of showing adverts with malicious content, specifically when the user have clicked one and installed malicious or otherwise destructive program. Adware is one of the most widespread types of malware. You can get it in about a dozen ways from installing a free app from the Web to clicking banners on some dodgy sites. You may discover that your system is infected even after using some PP applications, like uTorrent. Every day, fraudsters discover more unobvious ways to get into your computer. And there is no reason for you to feel guilty almost everyone sometimes needs to use questionable programs. And adware is not so dangerous if you remove it in time. Adware is not very dangerous itself. It makes only minor changes to the system to facilitate its activity. However, if you remove it inappropriately and will not fix those changes, you will likely spectate various bugs in your web browser. Some problems may also appear in various apps with web interface because of the modified networking settings. Among the main changes it does are modifications to HOSTS file. It plays a role in controlling networking in Windows. Situated in the system partition, it contains information about the DNS servers necessary for connecting to the desired server. Typically, pages utilized by adware to showcase ads are internally protected to prevent them from being blocked by web browsers. When adware manipulates your HOSTS, the PC connects to a specific DNS address on the adware server, avoiding any blockages for connections. Browser settings may undergo changes for various reasons. Viruses can modify your homepage to accommodate multiple advertisements. Another possible alteration is the restriction of your settings window, particularly prevalent when adware is distributed as a browser plugin. This tactic hinders a straightforward browser reset, which is often an effective method for eliminating unwanted behavior. Many more problems may be addressed by adware advertisements. No legit companies will agree to an advertising contract with adware distributors, as you read. Hence, each ad can contain something malicious, and you never know which one and how dangerous this something is. Potentially unwanted programs, together with browser hijackers, will not make your files encrypted, like ransomware, for example. Still, it will bring chaos to your PC. Meanwhile, the Coin Miner Malware activity will make your system impossible to use and may even lead to hardware failures. Since the essence of adware is to throw advertisement banners at you, your devices infection with the disputed pest will not pass unnoticed. Such a penetration into your system would be the black advertisers complete failure if you didn't notice the adware's presence at all. Here we list the recognizable signs of your device having adware and requiring a quick remedy. Even if you're careful, you might still download adware by accident. Here's how to remove it from your device. Safari is the default browser on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. To get rid of adware in Safari Chrome is Googles browser and can be used on Android devices. To remove problematic apps from Chrome on your Android To protect your Android from bad apps To stop notifications from certain websites To remove adware from Chrome on your Windows computer To clean up Chrome adware on your Mac, Chromebook, or Linux device On iPhones and iPads, you might not need antivirus software, but if popups are bothering you, here's how to block them To remove adware from Firefox, you can reset it or remove the malicious toolbar. To reset Firefox to factory defaults To remove the malicious toolbar Not all adware is malware. Some of it is packaged with legitimate software, and many new computers come with various adware installed. If you get a new PC, you can check the list of installed programs in the settings to see if any unwanted software accompanies the computer. If your PC is new, another strategy is to reset it to a fresh installation of Windows. By resetting the computer to factory conditions, it can remove all third-party apps, including any installed adware. If you acquire adware on an existing computer, you can manually uninstall it using Add or Remove Programs in Settings, but only if you can definitively identify which program on your PC is the cause of the spyware. If you cant, then you might want to install our antimalware. This antivirus tool is adept at identifying and removing adware spyware. The best approach, of course, is prevention avoiding getting infected with spyware, to begin with. So here are some easy steps you can take to avoid getting spyware on your PC Download Adware Remover","Adware and Its Role in Cybersecurity Threats
Adware is a type of malware that forces users to view unwanted advertisements, often causing severe disruptions to user experience and posing significant privacy risks. It operates by making unauthorized changes to system and browser settings, frequently installing as a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) or browser hijacker. Beyond mere annoyance, adware can compromise user privacy by tracking browsing habits and personal data, which are often sold to third parties.

Notable adware examples include Fireball, which hijacks browsers for generating fraudulent ad revenue, and Gator, which monitors online behavior to deliver targeted ads. In severe cases, adware can download additional malware, including coin miners and spyware, exacerbating the risk to the infected system.

Legal and Technical Challenges in Combating Adware
Legally, adware straddles a fine line between nuisance and criminal activity. Federal and state laws in the U.S., such as California's Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act, prohibit unauthorized software installations. However, enforcement remains challenging, particularly when adware operates under the guise of legitimate advertising-supported software.

From a technical perspective, adware often modifies critical files like the HOSTS file to redirect web traffic through malicious DNS servers, bypassing browser security features. This tactic not only ensures the uninterrupted display of ads but also makes the system vulnerable to phishing and other cyber threats.

Preventative Measures and Removal Strategies
To mitigate the risks posed by adware, users are advised to adopt a multi-faceted approach, including the use of robust anti-malware tools and maintaining up-to-date software. Additionally, exercising caution when downloading free software or clicking on unfamiliar links is crucial. Infected systems require thorough cleaning, which may involve resetting browser settings, removing suspicious extensions, or using specialized adware removal tools.

Conclusion
Adware represents a persistent cybersecurity threat that, while often dismissed as a minor nuisance, can lead to significant privacy breaches and system vulnerabilities. Effective countermeasures include both preventative strategies and rigorous post-infection protocols to safeguard personal and corporate data.","1. What is adware?

httpsmediumcomCyb3rsecurityvulnerability-scanning-v-s-penetration-testing-1214980c54ec,"Penetration testing scope is typically targeted and there is always a human factor involved. There is no automated penetration testing which requires the use of tools, sometimes a lot of tools. But it also requires an extremely experienced person to conduct penetration testing. A good penetration tester always at some point during their testing craft a script, change parameters of an attack or tweak settings of the tools he or she may be using. It could be at application or network level but specific to a function, department or number of assets. One can include the whole infrastructure and all applications but that is impractical in the real world because of cost and time. You define your scope on a number of factors that are mainly based on risk and how important is an asset. Some of the penetration tester Spends a lot of money on low risk assets which may take a number of days to exploit is not practical. Penetration testing requires high skilled knowledge and that's why it is costly. Testers often exploit a new vulnerability or discover vulnerabilities that are not known to normal business processes. Penetration testing normally can take from days to a few weeks, it is often conducted once a year and reports are short and to the point. It does have a higher than average chance of causing outages. On the other hand, vulnerability scanning is the act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, servers and applications. It is automated and focuses on finding potential and know vulnerabilities on the network or an application level. It does not exploit the vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners only identify potential vulnerabilities they do not exploit the vulnerabilities. Hence, they are not built to find zero day exploits. The scope of vulnerability scanning is business wide, requiring automated tools to manage a high number of assets. It is wider in scope than penetration testing. Products specific knowledge is needed to effectively use the vulnerability scans product. It is usually run by administrators or security personnel with good networking knowledge. Vulnerability scans can be run frequently on any number of assets to ascertain known vulnerabilities are detected and patched. Thus, you can eliminate more serious vulnerabilities for your valuable resources quickly. An effective way to remediate vulnerabilities is to follow the vulnerability management lifecycle. The cost of a vulnerability scan is low to moderate as compared to penetration testing, and it is a detective control as opposed to preventive like penetration testing. Vulnerability management can be fed into patch management for effective patching. Patches must be tested on a test system before rolling out to production. Businesses must manually check each vulnerability before testing again Does not confirm that a vulnerability is exploitable See Also Picking Your Vulnerability Scanner The Questions You Should Ask Both tests work together to encourage optimal network and application security. Vulnerability scans are great weekly, monthly, or quarterly insight into your network security the quick Xray, while penetration tests are a very thorough way to deeply examine your network security the periodic detailed MRI. Yes, penetration tests are expensive, but you are paying a professional to examine every nook and cranny of your business the way a real world attacker would, to find a possibility of compromise. Originally published at httpscybrsecurty.blogspot.com. ","Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning are both essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy, though they serve different purposes and have distinct methodologies. Penetration testing is a targeted, manual process conducted by highly skilled professionals who use various tools, scripts, and attack techniques to identify vulnerabilities. Unlike automated tools, penetration testers customize their approach to the specific assets and risks of an organization, often uncovering new or previously unknown vulnerabilities. This testing, which can take days or weeks, is typically done annually and may cause outages. It is a high-cost, high-skill activity focused on identifying critical risks and mimicking real-world attack strategies to test a network's defenses.

In contrast, vulnerability scanning is an automated process that identifies known vulnerabilities in network devices, servers, applications, and other infrastructure components. It does not exploit vulnerabilities but simply flags potential weaknesses, making it a valuable tool for detecting and managing risks on a broader scale. Vulnerability scans are typically run more frequently—such as weekly or monthly—and are used to quickly identify and patch known issues. While the cost of vulnerability scanning is lower than penetration testing, it does not provide the same depth of insight or confirm whether a vulnerability is exploitable. These scans are often used as part of a vulnerability management lifecycle, which feeds into patch management processes to ensure timely remediation of known vulnerabilities.

Both methods complement each other, with vulnerability scans offering a quick overview of a network's security posture and penetration testing providing a more thorough examination. By combining the two, organizations can gain a comprehensive understanding of their security vulnerabilities and better defend against cyberattacks.","1. What is the scope of penetration testing?

httpssecurelistcomksb-financial-and-crimeware-predictions-2025114565,"Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team constantly monitors known and emerging cyberthreats directed at the financial industry, with banks and fintech companies being the most targeted. We also closely follow threats that aim to infiltrate a wider range of industries, namely ransomware families that are financially motivated.

These observations, as part of our Kaspersky Security Bulletin, help us devise predictions about how the financial cyberthreat landscape will change over the year. This report outlines notable attack trends we expect to face, to help businesses and individuals protect from them. Let’s first look into our predictions for 2024 to see how they turned out, explore the key events in the financial cyberthreat landscape during the year, and then try to predict the trends for 2025.

Increase in AI-powered cyberattacks ? True The prediction that anticipated an upsurge in cyberattacks leveraging machine learning tools turned out to be true. In 2024, we saw cyberattacks boosted by AI emerge not only through emails, manipulated ads, phishing attacks (approximately 21% of phishing emails are now generated by AI) and other content, but also as an effective way to bypass biometric authentication. Machine learning tools allowed criminals to open new accounts using leaked data, impersonating the victims and bypassing security mechanisms used in the KYC (know-your-customer) process, manipulating and changing faces, videos, pictures, etc. Threat actors like Gringo 171 specialized in developing these tools, selling them to any criminal interested in bypassing biometrics authentication. As an example, in one recent case, Brazilian Federal Police arrested criminals who were using AI-powered tools to open bank accounts for money laundering. They opened thousands of accounts, creating fake faces and easily bypassing biometric checking.

Fraudulent schemes targeting direct payment systems ? True The prediction that cybercriminals would exploit direct payment systems like PIX, FedNow and UPI through clippers and mobile banking Trojans was confirmed. We saw the appearance of GoPIX, a banking Trojan in Brazil targeting the PIX real-time payment system and implementing clipboard monitoring as a way of changing keys and stealing payments. The same technique was used in a Trojan targeting Android devices. Other banking Trojan families already implemented cryptocurrency stealing functionality by targeting the sites directly, or intercepting user clipboard. While there haven’t been any major publicly reported fraud cases directly tied to the FedNow system as of October 2024, concerns about the potential for fraud remain high. FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s real-time payment service, allows for instant fund transfers, but its rapid nature can be exploited by fraudsters, especially in the form of authorized push payment (APP) fraud. Regarding UPI, the national direct payment system of India, scammers spammed UPI IDs with multiple collect requests. It’s easy to crack a UPI ID as it is generally formed with the user’s mobile number followed by the UPI provider name. Scammers can obtain victims’ phone numbers, as they are widely used in public — for online shopping, in malls, restaurants and so on. Users have been getting many fraudulent money collect and autopay requests from Netflix, Google Pay, etc. in their UPI accounts. In some cases, these are authentic UPI autopay requests initiated by fraudsters from their Netflix accounts, making an unsuspecting user essentially pay for the scammer’s subscription. Finally, we have noticed a rise in fake instant payment apps in Latin America, used to carry out different kinds of scams. In this context, cybercriminal groups are developing apps that convincingly mimic monetary transactions, displaying a fake receipt without any real connection to transactional systems, to trick sellers into engaging in illegal or loss-making transactions. These apps are sold on dark web forums to scammers who use them to make fake purchases on behalf of small businesses.

Global adoption of Automated Transfer Systems (ATS) ?? Partially true The prediction suggested that attacks with mobile ATS will become adopted globally. While mobile banking Trojans using ATS were already a reality, their global adoption is still underway. One of the groups behind the development of a particular malware family using this technique in Brazil was planning to expand their attacks to Europe by launching a test version of the malware. However, before they had a chance to spread out, they were arrested following a Kaspersky notification to the Brazilian police. Moreover, with Google continuing to restrict even further the Accessibility permission in newer Android versions, we believe it will be harder for malware in general to apply the ATS trick in future mobile banking Trojan developments, as this needs accessibility settings enabled.

Resurgence of the Brazilian banking Trojans ? True The prediction that attacks by the Brazilian banking Trojans would become more extensive, and Grandoreiro would gain momentum was confirmed. The Brazilian banking Trojans arose in 2024 as a global threat, targeting many countries and expanding their reach. The most prevalent families in 2024 have been Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro (the Tetrade group). Other families are Banbra, BestaFera, Bizarro, ChePro, Casbaneiro, Ponteiro, and Coyote. Grandoreiro expanded to target more than 1700 banks in 45 countries, on every continent, and even the arrest of several gang members didn’t stop them. In the top 30 banking Trojan families we detected worldwide, 11 are of Brazilian origin and account for 22% of all detections on our users in 2024 (according to the KSN statistics gathered from January to October 2024).

Ransomware target selection ? True The prediction suggested that ransomware groups would turn to more targeted, highly selective attacks. In 2024, ransomware groups have intensified their focus on high-value targets, with larger organizations, particularly those whose revenue exceeds $5 billion, continuing to be the primary marks due to a likelihood of extracting higher ransoms from these. This trend aligns with a shift toward targeting of financial services and especially banking institutions, there being a marked increase in attacks. Banks alone accounted for 20% of ransomware incidents in this sector. The average ransom demand rose by $400,000 from 2023 to 2024, underscoring attackers’ pursuit of higher payouts. However, while the most skillful ransomware operators have homed in on high-profile sectors, other groups continue to strike broadly, impacting the government, healthcare, and education sectors. This dual approach drove a 21.5% rise in ransomware incidents from Q1 to Q2 2024 and a year-over-year increase of 4.3% in the first half of the year, suggesting that, despite a selective trend, ransomware still remains a widespread threat across industries.

Open-source backdoored packages ? True The prediction anticipated a worrying increase in open-source backdoor packages, which we observed to be true. The XZ Backdoor was a major incident affecting Linux distributions when backdoored packages ended up inside popular OSS. We did an extensive analysis of this backdoor here, here and here. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the only one, as we saw many other similar incidents this year.

Decrease in 0-days, increase in 1-day exploits ? False The prediction that crimeware actors would shift from zero-day to first-day exploits has proven inaccurate for 2024, as recent trends indicate a sustained and even heightened reliance on zero-day vulnerabilities. According to CVE.org, it registered 28,961 vulnerabilities in their catalog in 2023, while January through November 2024, the program registered 29,004, the highest number ever recorded. According to the Rapid7 2024 Attack Intelligence Report, the use of zero-day exploits has surged, with 53% of widely exploited CVEs recently beginning as zero-day attacks — a trend observed in two of the last three years. This focus on zero-days has been reinforced by the sophisticated and orchestrated nature of recent attacks, where 23% of widespread threat CVEs have been attributed to high-value zero-day vulnerabilities. The commercial market for zero-day exploits is also booming, with brokers offering significant payouts, such as up to $2 million for iPhone zero-days. In contrast, there is no evidence pointing to a rise in first-day exploit usage among crimeware actors, underlining that zero-day attacks remain a primary tactic in the cybersecurity threat landscape.

Exploitation of misconfigured devices and services ? True The prediction regarding the exploitation of misconfigured devices and services has proved accurate in 2024, as evidenced by the EMERALDWHALE operation. This global campaign specifically targeted misconfigured Git setups, resulting in the theft of over 15,000 cloud service credentials and unauthorized access to more than 10,000 private repositories. The impact was extensive, compromising various services, including cloud providers and email platforms, which underscores the widespread nature of vulnerabilities relating by misconfiguration. Attackers used private, automated tools to scan, extract, and verify stolen tokens from misconfigured services, significantly expanding their reach and efficiency. This misconfiguration trend also exposed sensitive data stored in configuration files, such as Laravel’s .env files, and highlighted cloud storage vulnerabilities, such as a compromised Amazon S3 bucket containing over a terabyte of sensitive information.

Fluid composition of affiliate groups ? True The prediction suggesting a more fluid distinction between cybercrime groups has proven accurate. In 2024, the ransomware ecosystem has become increasingly dynamic and adaptable, with affiliates adopting a “multi-platform” approach. Many threat actors are now working with multiple ransomware families simultaneously, allowing them to optimize their operations and mitigate risks associated with relying on a single group. For instance, cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates actively participating in campaigns for different ransomware families, switching between groups like BlackMatter, and newly emerged ones, such as RansomHub. This strategic approach allows them to maintain a constant stream of attacks by leveraging different ransomware strains depending on the target, potential payout, and current operational status of each RaaS platform. The fragmentation of the ransomware landscape is evident, with the number of groups listing victims rising from 43 to 68 and the emergence of 31 new groups in the past year alone. This decentralization complicates law enforcement efforts, as tracking and containing these groups has become more challenging due to their agile structure and international reach. Smaller groups like Medusa and Cloak are capitalizing on this fluid environment, offering attractive profit-sharing on dark web resources to draw affiliates. For example, Medusa is offering up to 90% profit-sharing to attract affiliates, while Cloak allows affiliates to join without any initial payment. Meanwhile, established platforms continue to evolve their offerings to retain and attract skilled operators.

Adoption of less popular / cross-platform languages ? True The prediction anticipated that cybercriminals would turn to lesser-known programming languages to evade detection. Multiple threats have emerged from the adoption of fairly new or non-standard programming languages used for malware development. Tooling like KrustyLoader (a loader implant written in Rust), NKAbuse, or even K4Spreader (a loader used by 8220 Gang and written in Golang) has been caught in the wild. Moreover, we saw Trojan spies, banking Trojans and other financially motivated malware developed in Go. These are a clear signal that malware developers make use of these languages not only because of their practicality and easy portability to different OSs, but also because they make analysis a more strenuous task.","In 2024, cyberattacks targeting the financial sector saw significant shifts in tactics and technologies. One of the most notable trends was the rise of AI-powered cyberattacks, where machine learning tools were leveraged to enhance phishing, manipulate ads, and bypass biometric security systems. Criminals used AI to open accounts using stolen data, impersonating victims and bypassing KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. For example, Brazilian criminals utilized AI-powered tools to create fake faces and bypass biometric checks to open thousands of bank accounts for money laundering.

Another major threat was fraud targeting direct payment systems such as PIX, FedNow, and UPI. Banking Trojans like GoPIX were specifically designed to exploit these systems by intercepting payment data or altering transaction details using clipboard monitoring. While the FedNow system itself had not experienced major fraud incidents, concerns around its vulnerability, especially related to authorized push payment (APP) fraud, remained high. Similarly, the UPI system in India saw an increase in scams involving fraudulent payment requests and fake apps designed to deceive users and small businesses into engaging in loss-making transactions.

Additionally, ransomware groups increasingly focused on high-value, high-profile targets such as large banks and financial institutions. Ransom demands rose, with banks accounting for a significant portion of ransomware attacks in 2024. Ransomware operators refined their tactics, adopting a more selective targeting strategy while still maintaining attacks across other sectors like government and healthcare. This shift indicated that cybercriminals were shifting their efforts toward sectors with a higher potential for large payouts.

Another concerning development was the exploitation of open-source backdoored packages, with attacks targeting widely used software distributions, especially in Linux environments. This year, backdoors like the XZ Backdoor were found in popular open-source software packages, increasing the risk for developers and organizations relying on these tools. At the same time, the use of zero-day vulnerabilities continued to be a preferred method of attack, with zero-day exploits outpacing first-day exploits in terms of usage by cybercriminals.

The cybersecurity landscape in 2024 also saw a significant rise in misconfigured devices and services being exploited by cybercriminals. One major example was the EMERALDWHALE operation, where attackers targeted misconfigured Git setups to steal cloud service credentials and access private repositories. This campaign underscored the dangers of improper configurations in cloud environments, highlighting the importance of regular security audits and configuration management to prevent unauthorized access.

As cyber threats evolve, the need for robust security measures and continuous monitoring remains critical, particularly for financial institutions that are increasingly targeted by sophisticated, AI-enhanced cyberattacks.","1.

https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-security,"Artificial intelligence's impact on society, including computer security, is widely debated. Many argue that AI improves the quality of everyday life by doing routine and even complicated tasks better than humans can, making life simpler, safer, and more efficient. Others argue AI poses dangerous privacy risks, exacerbates racism by standardizing people, and costs workers their jobs leading to greater unemployment.

Computer security, also called cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.

computer security, the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.

The security precautions related to computer information and access address four major threats: (1) theft of data, such as that of military secrets from government computers; (2) vandalism, including the destruction of data by a computer virus; (3) fraud, such as employees at a bank channeling funds into their own accounts; and (4) invasion of privacy, such as the illegal accessing of protected personal financial or medical data from a large database. The most basic means of protecting a computer system against theft, vandalism, invasion of privacy, and other irresponsible behaviours is to electronically track and record the access to, and activities of, the various users of a computer system. This is commonly done by assigning an individual password to each person who has access to a system. The computer system itself can then automatically track the use of these passwords, recording such data as which files were accessed under particular passwords and so on. Another security measure is to store a system’s data on a separate device or medium that is normally inaccessible through the computer system. Finally, data is often encrypted so that it can be deciphered only by holders of a singular encryption key. (See data encryption.)

Computer security has become increasingly important since the late 1960s, when modems (devices that allow computers to communicate over telephone lines) were introduced. The proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s compounded the problem because they enabled hackers (irresponsible computerphiles) to illegally access major computer systems from the privacy of their homes. With the tremendous growth of the Internet in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, computer security became a widespread concern. The development of advanced security techniques aims to diminish such threats, though concurrent refinements in the methods of computer crime pose ongoing hazards.","Computer security, or cybersecurity, is essential for protecting computer systems and sensitive information from threats like theft, vandalism, fraud, and invasion of privacy. To safeguard computer hardware, common protective measures include serial numbers, locks, and alarms. However, protecting information and system access involves more complex tactics, such as tracking user access, assigning individual passwords, and encrypting data. Password tracking systems log user activities, including the files accessed under specific passwords, while encryption ensures that data can only be read by authorized users with the correct decryption key.

The introduction of modems in the late 20th century and the rise of personal computers in the 1990s increased the vulnerability of systems to unauthorized access, particularly through hackers. With the growth of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, cybersecurity became a widespread concern, as it enabled malicious actors to illegally access systems remotely. As a result, there has been a continuous effort to develop advanced security techniques to combat cyber threats, although the sophistication of cybercrimes has also evolved, creating ongoing risks. 

Key threats to computer security include data theft (e.g., stealing military secrets), vandalism (such as viruses destroying data), fraud (e.g., embezzlement), and privacy breaches (e.g., illegal access to financial or medical data).

httpswwwbritannicacomtopiccyberattack,"cyberattack, deliberate and malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to a digital system. Cyberattacks can affect computers, smartphones, or other Internet-connected devices. Cybercriminals main goal is often to steal money, personal information, credentials, intellectual property, or otherwise valuable information. Attackers may also aim to disrupt or cripple the targeted system. Cyberattacks are often a precursor to more serious cybercrime, such as identity theft, invasion of privacy, and fraud. Such attacks occur every day, and more than half of them result in damages of , or more each. The average cost of a data breach is . million, and some estimates indicate that cybercrime will cost the world . trillion annually by . The most advanced cyberattacks have disrupted industrial machinery, transportation, and Internet service to entire regions they have even left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity. Cyberattacks present a significant threat to computer systems not only because of the damage they can cause but also because of their low cost of entry. With mastery over certain software, one person could launch an attack against an entire country. Moreover, attackers can easily hide their identity, location, and motive. Cyber defense measures must repeatedly deter attacks that may differ in scope and method, whereas a cyberattack needs to succeed only once an unprotected server can face hundreds of attacks a day. The line between cyber defense and cyberattack, however, sometimes blurs. For example, Pegasus spyware was explicitly designed for national security and law enforcement but was used to track and monitor influential individuals without their knowledge. Both individuals and organizations can perpetrate cyberattacks, but such attacks differ from cyberwar, which is typically waged between countries. Cyberwar can include physical attacks against digital infrastructure such as destroying communications systems or hardware in addition to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks target a systems syntactic layer, its semantic layer, or both. Syntactic cyberattacks center on software and, in most cases, involve malware a portmanteau of malicious and software. Semantic cyberattacks attempt to trick victims into providing valuable information or access to valuable systems, using a strategy known as social engineering. A common example of social engineering is phishing the practice of sending fraudulent emails that impersonate trustworthy contacts to ask for personal information. Cyberattacks generally operate in four broad phases. Attackers start with reconnaissance, during which they probe for weaknesses and gather information within a targets system. They may use social engineering to obtain private information and may consider aligned targets, such as partners, customers, or suppliers. During this stage, the attackers typically research how to breach the system and whether that will require creating or buying malware or conducting trials. The second phase is delivery, during which the attackers implement a plan to infiltrate the target. Common methods include using an infected USB, creating a fake website, or planting a link within an email. Attackers may even resort to more traditional forms of crime, such as bribery or blackmail. The third phase of a cyberattack is breaching. If the infiltration plan succeeds, the attackers gain access to the targets system and establish a digital presence. The fourth phase is the attack. Now that the attackers have gained access to their targets system, they may attempt to breach more valuable networks or to establish a more permanent presence. They may also attempt to disable system security measures. The attackers can then proceed with their plans depending on the target, they may be interested in sending bank payments, disrupting or crippling business operations, stealing intellectual property or sensitive information, or otherwise changing the network. They can disrupt the system to gain remote control over it, perhaps even connecting it to other compromised devices. Advanced attackers typically vacate the system and remove evidence of their presence after they have achieved their goals they may even disguise their work as someone elses. In some cases, they leave behind a back door for future access or to sell access to other cybercriminals. Some attackers, however, wreak havoc merely to attract attention to their success. Cyberattacks can be classified into two categories untargeted and targeted. Untargeted attacks aim to affect as many devices or services as possible. For example, infiltrators sometimes use water holing, in which a web page is created or compromised and visitors are then attacked as they access the page. Another example is scanning, in which attackers systematically attempt to find vulnerabilities in a system, often aiming for points of entry. Targeted cyberattacks are tailored to a specific individual or organization. The culprit is often external, but internal actors can also compromise a system. Malware is an umbrella term for software programs used in cyberattacks, typically installed on victims devices when they interact with a dangerous link or email. For example, electronic games or applications from a third-party service may hide malware within their software packages. Attackers may also try baiting, a strategy in which malware is left in a public online space, such as a web page. Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, spyware, and adware. Scareware uses false alerts to pressure a user into downloading further malware or into providing valuable information. Ransomware, also called crypto viral extortion, blocks access to a digital asset or device until the owner pays a ransom. Payments have been as much as million. Ransomware is the second most common form of cyberattack in fact, there are organizations that sell ransomware attacks as a service, enabling others to conduct such attacks. Software exists to detect and combat malware, and operating systems are continually updated to minimize weaknesses. However, malware has advanced just as quickly as cyber defense strategies and tools. Phishing is a common social engineering tactic in which cyber  attackers impersonate trusted sources, typically via email, to steal valuable data or to install malware. Spear phishing is the term for sending such emails to specific targets in an organization whale phishing is a subcategory that targets company executives. Business email compromise scams occur when cybercriminals impersonate an executive or a business associate and ask that money be wired to a specific account. A denial of service DoS attack overwhelms its target with traffic and thus prevents legitimate use. Distributed denial of service DDoS attacks occur when the source of the traffic is not a single entity but many, typically involving the use of a botnet. A botnet is a network of connected devices termed zombie computers that are all infected with malware, allowing attackers to use them for their own purposes without owner authorization. The largest discovered botnet comprised nearly two million computers. Man in the middle MitM attacks, sometimes called eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers intercept communications either between people or between an individual and a server. Unsecured public networks provide a relatively easy environment for attackers to spy on and intercept Internet traffic. Session hijacking attacks are a subcategory of MitM attacks in which attackers match their IP address to that of a legitimate user, thereby gaining the same level of access on the users server. Simply ensuring that all software is up to date and avoiding unknown links can be an effective strategy to prevent cyberattacks. Identity and access management strategies, such as multifactor authentication, strong passwords, and virtual private networks VPNs, provide added levels of security. Firewalls and Internet encryption can prevent bad actors from interacting with a network. Additionally, data loss prevention tools can monitor security threats and aid in backing up important data in the event of a breach. Organizations can work to deter cyberattacks by educating employees on cybersecurity tips, enlisting third-party security experts, or investing in an internal cybersecurity team. Such teams can take measures to root out system weaknesses, detect cyberattacks, and create response plans in the aftermath of an attack. Although it is impossible to be completely secure from cyberattacks, such measures can help to lessen potential damage.","Pegasus spyware has been widely discussed due to its dual-use nature, marketed as a tool for enhancing national security but subsequently used for unlawful surveillance of journalists, political figures, and human rights activists. This spyware’s ability to infiltrate devices without detection raises significant ethical concerns, especially regarding privacy rights and the potential misuse of such powerful surveillance technology. Initially intended to assist in counterterrorism efforts, its deployment by authoritarian regimes to monitor and silence opposition blurs the line between legitimate cybersecurity measures and cyberattacks, exposing the fine balance between defense and abuse in the digital age.

Cyberattacks, in general, represent a significant threat to the integrity of digital systems and information. These deliberate and malicious efforts often aim to steal sensitive data, cause disruption, or damage a target’s infrastructure. The most common cyberattacks are financially motivated, with criminals targeting individuals or organizations to steal money, intellectual property, or credentials. Additionally, more destructive forms of cyberattacks can disable essential systems, such as industrial machinery, public services, and even power grids. The motivations behind cyberattacks vary widely, but their ultimate goal is often to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems for personal gain or to exert control over critical infrastructure.

The stages of a cyberattack typically unfold in phases, beginning with reconnaissance, where attackers gather intelligence about their target’s system and look for weak points to exploit. Next comes delivery, where the attacker executes their plan to breach the system, often using phishing emails, infected USB drives, or malicious websites to gain access. Once inside, the attacker establishes a presence in the system during the breaching phase, which sets the stage for the final phase: the attack itself. In this stage, attackers may exfiltrate sensitive data, install malicious software, or disrupt system operations, depending on their objectives. These phases are designed to be stealthy, with the attacker aiming to avoid detection while maximizing the damage to the system.

Malware plays a significant role in cyberattacks, encompassing a wide range of harmful software designed to infiltrate and damage systems. This category includes viruses, worms, and ransomware, which are all capable of crippling digital environments. Ransomware, in particular, has seen a surge in popularity, with cybercriminals locking systems or data and demanding large sums of money for their release. Phishing, another common attack method, relies on social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links. This form of deception has become more sophisticated, with attackers tailoring their messages to specific targets, a practice known as spear-phishing. Meanwhile, Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks are designed to interrupt or intercept communication systems, further highlighting the diverse and ever-evolving nature of cyber threats.

In this landscape, cybersecurity measures must be dynamic, continuously adapting to the latest threats. The line between defense and offense becomes blurred, as shown with tools like Pegasus spyware, which exemplifies how surveillance technology initially developed for security can be misused, turning into a form of cyberattack itself. This complexity underscores the challenges organizations and governments face in safeguarding against an ever-growing array of cyber threats.","1. What is a cyberattack?

Because of the early and widespread adoption of computers and the Internet in the United States , most of the earliest victims and villains of cybercrime were Americans. By the 21st century, though, hardly a hamlet remained anywhere in the world that had not been touched by cybercrime of one sort or another.

cybercrime , the use of a computer as an instrument to further illegal ends, such as committing fraud , trafficking in child pornography and intellectual property, stealing identities , or violating privacy. Cybercrime, especially through the Internet , has grown in importance as the computer has become central to commerce, entertainment, and government.

Defining cybercrime

New technologies create new criminal opportunities but few new types of crime. What distinguishes cybercrime from traditional criminal activity? Obviously, one difference is the use of the digital computer, but technology alone is insufficient for any distinction that might exist between different realms of criminal activity. Criminals do not need a computer to commit fraud, traffic in child pornography and intellectual property, steal an identity, or violate someone’s privacy. All those activities existed before the “cyber” prefix became ubiquitous. Cybercrime, especially involving the Internet, represents an extension of existing criminal behaviour alongside some novel illegal activities.

Most cybercrime is an attack on information about individuals, corporations, or governments. Although the attacks do not take place on a physical body, they do take place on the personal or corporate virtual body, which is the set of informational attributes that define people and institutions on the Internet. In other words, in the digital age our virtual identities are essential elements of everyday life: we are a bundle of numbers and identifiers in multiple computer databases owned by governments and corporations. Cybercrime highlights the centrality of networked computers in our lives, as well as the fragility of such seemingly solid facts as individual identity.

An important aspect of cybercrime is its nonlocal character: actions can occur in jurisdictions separated by vast distances. This poses severe problems for law enforcement since previously local or even national crimes now require international cooperation. For example, if a person accesses child pornography located on a computer in a country that does not ban child pornography, is that individual committing a crime in a nation where such materials are illegal? Where exactly does cybercrime take place? Cyberspace is simply a richer version of the space where a telephone conversation takes place, somewhere between the two people having the conversation. As a planet-spanning network, the Internet offers criminals multiple hiding places in the real world as well as in the network itself. However, just as individuals walking on the ground leave marks that a skilled tracker can follow, cybercriminals leave clues as to their identity and location, despite their best efforts to cover their tracks. In order to follow such clues across national boundaries, though, international cybercrime treaties must be ratified.

In 1996 the Council of Europe, together with government representatives from the United States, Canada, and Japan, drafted a preliminary international treaty covering computer crime. Around the world, civil libertarian groups immediately protested provisions in the treaty requiring Internet service providers (ISPs) to store information on their customers’ transactions and to turn this information over on demand. Work on the treaty proceeded nevertheless, and on November 23, 2001, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime was signed by 30 states. The convention came into effect in 2004. Additional protocols, covering terrorist activities and racist and xenophobic cybercrimes, were proposed in 2002 and came into effect in 2006. In addition, various national laws, such as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have expanded law enforcement’s power to monitor and protect computer networks.","Cybercrime refers to the use of computers to commit illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, trafficking in child pornography, intellectual property theft, and violations of privacy. As the Internet became central to commerce, entertainment, and government in the 21st century, cybercrime grew in scope and scale, affecting individuals, corporations, and governments worldwide. While many activities associated with cybercrime, such as fraud and privacy violations, existed before the rise of digital technologies, cybercrime now represents an extension of these behaviors in the online space, targeting virtual identities and the information that defines individuals and organizations on the Internet.

A significant feature of cybercrime is its nonlocal nature, where actions can occur across vast geographical distances, making enforcement challenging. This international dimension necessitates cooperation between countries to address cybercrime, especially as criminals can hide behind the anonymity offered by the Internet. For example, a person accessing illegal content from a country where it's not prohibited raises complex jurisdictional issues. Efforts to address these challenges have led to the creation of international cybercrime treaties, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which provides frameworks for cross-border cooperation in combating cybercrime.

Cybercrime spans a wide spectrum, from breaches of personal and corporate privacy—such as data manipulation and identity theft—to transaction-based crimes like fraud and digital piracy. At the extreme end of this spectrum, cyberterrorism involves the deliberate disruption of national infrastructures and public safety through cyberattacks. These activities, including hacking and denial of service attacks, have become more concerning in the wake of incidents like the September 11 attacks. Advanced technologies, such as spyware like Pegasus, have further blurred the lines between law enforcement and cybercrime, as they are used not only for legitimate surveillance but also for covertly tracking individuals without their knowledge, raising significant ethical and legal issues.","1.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/cyberwar,"cyberwar, war conducted in and from computers and the networks connecting them, waged by states or their proxies against other states. Cyberwar is usually waged against government and military networks in order to disrupt, destroy, or deny their use. Cyberwar should not be confused with the terrorist use of cyberspace or with cyberespionage or cybercrime. Even though similar tactics are used in all four types of activities, it is a misinterpretation to define them all as cyberwar. Some states that have engaged in cyberwar may also have engaged in disruptive activities such as cyberespionage, but such activities in themselves do not constitute cyberwar. Computers and the networks that connect them are collectively known as the domain of cyberspace. Western states depend on cyberspace for the everyday functioning of nearly all aspects of modern society, and developing states are becoming more reliant upon cyberspace every year. Everything modern society needs to function from critical infrastructures and financial institutions to modes of commerce and tools for national security depends to some extent upon cyberspace. Therefore, the threat of cyberwar and its purported effects are a source of great concern for governments and militaries around the world, and several serious cyberattacks have taken place that, while not necessarily meeting a strict definition of cyberwar, can serve as an illustration of what might be expected in a real cyberwar of the future. One of the first references to the term cyberwar can be found in Cyberwar Is Coming, a landmark article by John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, two researchers for the RAND Corporation, published in in the journal Comparative Strategy. The cyberspace domain is composed of three layers. The first is the physical layer, including hardware, cables, satellites, and other equipment. Without this physical layer, the other layers cannot function. The second is the syntactic layer, which includes the software providing the operating instructions for the physical equipment. The third is the semantic layer and involves human interaction with the information generated by computers and the way that information is perceived and interpreted by its user. All three layers are vulnerable to attack. Cyberwar attacks can be made against the physical infrastructure of cyberspace by using traditional weapons and combat methods. For example, computers can be physically destroyed, their networks can be interfered with or destroyed, and the human users of this physical infrastructure can be suborned, duped, or killed in order to gain physical access to a network or computer. Physical attacks usually occur during conventional conflicts, such as in the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations NATOs Operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia in and in the U.S.led operation against Iraq in , where communication networks, computer facilities, and telecommunications were damaged or destroyed. Attacks can be made against the syntactic layer by using cyberweapons that destroy, interfere with, corrupt, monitor, or otherwise damage the software operating the computer systems. Such weapons include malware, malicious software such as viruses, trojans, spyware, and worms that can introduce corrupted code into existing software, causing a computer to perform actions or processes unintended by its operator. Other cyberweapons include distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, in which attackers, using malware, hijack a large number of computers to create so-called botnets, groups of zombie computers that then attack other targeted computers, preventing their proper function. This method was used in cyberattacks against Estonia in April and May and against Georgia in August . On both occasions it is alleged that Russian hackers, mostly civilians, conducted denial of service attacks against key government, financial, media, and commercial Web sites in both countries. These attacks temporarily denied access by the governments and citizens of those countries to key sources of information and to internal and external communications. Finally, semantic cyberattacks, also known as social engineering, manipulate human users perceptions and interpretations of computer generated data in order to obtain valuable information such as passwords, financial details, and classified government information from the users through fraudulent means. Social engineering techniques include phishing in which attackers send seemingly innocuous emails to targeted users, inviting them to divulge protected information for apparently legitimate purposes and baiting, in which malware infected software is left in a public place in the hope that a target user will find and install it, thus compromising the entire computer system. In August , for example, fans of the Anglo-Indian movie star Katrina Kaif were lured into accessing a Web site that was supposed to have a revealing photograph of the actress. Once in the site, visitors were automatically forwarded to a well-known social networking site and asked to enter their login and password. With this information revealed by users, the phishing expedition was successfully completed. An example of baiting involves an incident in in which a flash memory drive infected with malware was inserted into the USB port of a computer at a U.S. military base in the Middle East. From there the computer code spread through a number of military networks, preparing to transfer data to an unnamed foreign intelligence service, before it was detected. As these above examples suggest, semantic methods are used mostly to conduct espionage and criminal activity. The term cyberwar is increasingly controversial. A number of experts in the fields of computer security and international politics question whether the term accurately characterizes the hostile activity occurring in cyberspace. Many suggest that the activities in question can be more accurately described as crime, espionage, or even terrorism but not necessarily as war, since the latter term has important political, legal, and military implications. For example, it is far from apparent that an act of espionage by one state against another via cyberspace equals an act of war just as traditional methods of espionage have rarely, if ever, led to war. Allegations of Chinese cyberespionage bear this out. A number of countries, including India, Germany, and the United States, believe that they have been victims of Chinese cyberespionage efforts. Nevertheless, while these incidents have been a cause of tension between China and the other countries, they have not damaged overall diplomatic relations. Similarly, criminal acts perpetrated in and from cyberspace by individuals or groups are viewed as a matter for law enforcement rather than the military, though there is evidence to suggest that Russian organized crime syndicates helped to facilitate the cyberattacks against Georgia in and that they were hired by either Hamas or Hezbollah to attack Israeli Web sites in January . On the other hand, a cyberattack made by one state against another state, resulting in damage against critical infrastructures such as the electrical grid, air traffic control systems, or financial networks, might legitimately be considered an armed attack if attribution could be proved. Some experts specializing in the laws of armed conflict question the notion that hostile cyber activities can cause war though they are more certain about the use of hostile cyber activities during war. They argue that such activities and techniques do not constitute a new kind of warfare but simply are used as a prelude to, and in conjunction with, traditional methods of warfare. Indeed, in recent years cyberwar has assumed a prominent role in armed conflicts, ranging from the Israeli Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon in to the Russian invasion of Georgia in . In these cases cyberattacks were launched by all belligerents before the actual armed conflicts began, and cyberattacks continued long after the shooting stopped, yet it cannot be claimed that the cyberattacks launched before the start of actual hostilities caused the conflicts. Similarly, the cyberattacks against Estonia in were conducted in the context of a wider political crisis surrounding the removal of a Soviet war memorial from the city centre of Tallinn to its suburbs, causing controversy among ethnic Russians in Estonia and in Russia itself. Such qualifications aside, it is widely believed that cyberwar not only will feature prominently in all future conflicts but will probably even constitute the opening phases of them. The role and prominence of cyberwar in conventional conflicts continues to escalate.","Cyberwar refers to conflict waged in cyberspace, where states or their proxies use digital technologies to attack other nations. Unlike cybercrime, which typically involves individual actors, or cyberespionage, cyberwar is a strategic attack often aimed at disrupting or destroying government or military networks. The primary targets of cyberwar are usually critical infrastructures, communications systems, and defense networks, making such attacks highly disruptive and potentially destructive to national security.

Cyberspace, which encompasses three layers—physical, syntactic, and semantic—is the domain of cyberwar. The physical layer includes hardware and communications infrastructure, the syntactic layer deals with the software controlling systems, and the semantic layer involves human interpretation of data. Cyberwarfare can target any of these layers. Physical attacks can involve traditional weapons or tactics to destroy or damage hardware, while syntactic attacks might use malware, such as viruses, worms, or DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, to disrupt systems. The 2007 and 2008 DDoS attacks against Estonia and Georgia respectively are prime examples of how cyberweapons can cripple nations’ digital infrastructures.

Semantic attacks, also known as social engineering, manipulate human interactions with data to achieve espionage or criminal objectives. These include techniques like phishing, where attackers deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, and baiting, where malware is covertly introduced through deceptive means. One notorious instance of baiting occurred in 2008, when a USB flash drive infected with malware was planted at a U.S. military base, allowing the virus to spread across military networks before it was discovered.

Cyberwar has already shown its potential to influence global conflicts, and as nations become more dependent on digital networks for everything from national security to financial systems, the risk of devastating cyberattacks grows. These attacks are often complex, involving a combination of hacking, espionage, and manipulation of public perception, making them difficult to defend against.","1. What is cyberwar?

httpswwwcoretechusblogcybersecurity-risk-assessment-explained-and-executed,"The most important technology concepts, strategies and actions uncovered for your business. When someone asks you about cybersecurity for your business, what is your response Do you feel strong, confident and informed If so, that's wonderful, but if you're like most business leaders today, this topic might feel a bit foreign and even uncomfortable. That's because cybersecurity covers a wide range of topics, services and tools that have evolved quickly. Cybersecurity is also technically complicated at times, and bad actors operate fast. And now, AI is increasing the number of people who can execute an automated attack effectively. On a positive note, AI is used to improve the prevention of attacks and breaches. Despite that, every organization must face the fact that cyber hacks and security are here to stay or risk devastating consequences. That truth only adds an element of fear to the mix, making these topics much more uncomfortable. It doesn't have to be that way. You can take charge of cybersecurity for your organization, and it starts with understanding the categories of cybersecurity risk assessment reviews. Today, you can understand the foundation of strong cybersecurity the risk assessment. As you learn about cybersecurity risk assessments, it will help you think systematically about your organizations cybersecurity and how you can craft a robust, effective strategy to identify threats and protect your business. A cybersecurity risk assessment is a systematic process that identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities within an organizations IT environment. A proper risk assessment is thorough and requires a framework. It should help you identify and prioritize weak points in your security. It can also point out ways to improve response planning and staff training topics. A cybersecurity risk assessment often serves as an early step in the broader process of building a robust cybersecurity plan to protect your business operations. Generally speaking, you can perform a cyber risk assessment however you want, but professionals in the business have taken the time to create a guide that many IT experts reference when devising risk assessment processes. This guide comes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the form of a formal risk management framework. The entire set of documentation will take some time and study to master, but the essentials are laid out in the steps below. An IT support provider that uses this framework can consult with you to build your organizations security posture and create a document that lays out that plan. Details matter when it comes to cybersecurity and protecting your business. What exactly comes under scrutiny during this process What areas need to be covered And what can you really expect from the vulnerability assessment These answers are found by looking at each major category of the assessment You'll find a detailed breakdown of each category below, highlighting exactly how IT service providers in Omaha and Lincoln investigate each category. The foundation of a risk assessment focuses on your assets and what makes them vulnerable. In fact, the NIST framework provides a list of assets and vulnerability categories Hardware and software are fairly straightforward. The assessment will list all of your hardware and software and review vulnerabilities associated with each. Vendor assessment is a little different. There is an evaluation of what access vendors have to your systems and how vendors and their tools might introduce new vulnerabilities to your organization. For example, a vendor regularly delivering receipt paper to a storefront probably has limited access and creates few vulnerabilities. Comparatively, a third-party IT vendor may have high levels of access to your data or systems. This level of access comes with more risk. An interface is a boundary between two or more systems and software elements. Both internal and external interfaces are evaluated for the smooth functioning, communication, security and collaboration internal to the organization. The internal interface assessment focuses on how devices, applications and systems within your organization communicate. Internal interface assessments can include items such as connections between servers, internal networks, employee devices and more. On the other hand, external interface assessments focus on how your systems communicate with outside entities. These assessments typically include remote access tools, cloud services, social media platforms, third-party applications, other institutions, and more. To protect your information technology environment access controls are typically put into place. The cybersecurity assessment evaluates the control models, guidelines, policies, and procedures. How the business safeguards sensitive data is also reviewed. Lastly, application updates come under review. Which systems are out of date and what process are you following to update your applications on a regular basis The best way to view updates is through a thorough audit, and a good risk assessment provides exactly that. Internal threats highlight areas where access control, network segmentation, and sufficient training can preemptively solve problems. Internal threats can be malicious or unintentional, and both require scrutiny due to their potential impacts. Primarily, an internal threat assessment views which parties in your organization have access to which systems. The assessment also gauges how much damage each individual could do, whether maliciously or accidentally. Then recommendations are made to prevent these threats. To put this in perspective, its easy to understand how a disgruntled staff member could implement deliberate harm. For example, a former employee with lingering access to internal systems could intentionally leak sensitive information or disrupt critical operations. A way to mitigate these threats is by implementing strict offboarding procedures that immediately revoke access to all systems when an employee leaves the company, and implementing regular audits of user permissions. What's often easier to miss is how simple password hygiene or social engineering could lead to a security breach. For instance, an employee might fall victim to a phishing email and unintentionally share their login credentials, granting cybercriminals access to the network. To reduce the risk of this unintentional threat, its crucial to implement ongoing security training and enforce best practices like multifactor authentication MFA and regular password updates. Insider errors account for a large number of data breaches every year, and a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment can put that issue into clear focus as well. External threat assessments analyze how attackers from outside your organization could potentially exploit your systems. Some examples of the external threats analyzed by these assessments are phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, and distributed denial of service DDoS attacks. An external threat assessment doesn't just focus on the technical methods an attacker might use, like exploiting insecure interfaces or outdated software. It also examines your organizations overall security posture, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control policies you have in place. This helps identify vulnerabilities that could leave your organization exposed to external attacks. External threat assessments also provide recommendations based on best practices to prevent, detect and correct controls for your organization. These recommendations can include upgrading outdated software, implementing security awareness training, upgrading your firewall and antimalware tools, as well as deploying intrusion detections. A security focused IT managed services provider knows the tools, best practices, and training to implement to protect, detect and even recover from security incidents. This is where the threat assessment really starts to illuminate the priorities.

Cybersecurity isn't just about installing firewalls or antivirus software. It’s about creating a comprehensive strategy that involves understanding, evaluating, and managing potential threats across all areas of your business, from internal processes to external attacks.

A cybersecurity risk assessment is the cornerstone of such a strategy. This systematic process identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in your organization's IT infrastructure, which can help guide decisions around improvements, resources, and threat responses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework is a widely respected guide for conducting these assessments, helping businesses frame their security posture effectively.

The assessment typically focuses on several key areas:

Assets and Vulnerabilities: Identifying critical hardware, software, and systems, and evaluating how vulnerable they are to cyber threats.
Internal and External Threats: Analyzing the potential risks from both internal sources (like disgruntled employees or poor password hygiene) and external threats (like phishing, malware, or DDoS attacks).
System Impacts: Understanding the possible consequences of a breach or attack, allowing businesses to prioritize which systems or data are most critical to protect.
Risk Responses: Creating tailored recommendations for mitigating identified risks, from upgrading outdated software to implementing multi-factor authentication and ensuring proper vendor management.
By engaging a professional IT support provider, your business can stay ahead of cybersecurity risks and ensure you're meeting industry standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices to protect your operations, data, and reputation. The assessment will not only highlight where you need to improve but will also provide a clear action plan to strengthen your defenses.

In short, while cybersecurity may feel intimidating, especially with the increasing sophistication of attacks, taking proactive steps through risk assessments can empower your business to defend against both current and future threats.

httpswwwcoretechusblogguide-to-managing-passwords,"The most important technology concepts, strategies and actions uncovered for your business. Cybersecurity is one of the scariest words in modern business, even in Omaha and Lincoln, NE. It feels mysterious and complicated, and to be fair, it is often both of those things. Even so, cybersecurity can realistically be simplified to specific tools and training. If you use good password practices, you eliminate the vast majority of security risks. It actually can be that easy, and it gets even easier when you utilize a password manager. Password managers are useful for safely storing your passwords, and that becomes apparent pretty quickly. How many different passwords do you use in a single day According to research by tech.co, the average person contends with passwords on a regular basis. That's obviously too many to remember. So, the password manager remembers them for you, and that saves you time resetting them. In fact, its so convenient that a lot of people don't even realize that their phones provide native password management. How many times do you have to type a password for an app on your phone If the answer is just once, that's because the phones password manager handles things after that. The convenience of a web based password manager might be obvious, but there's a second, more important reason why you need a password manager password hygiene. What does this mean Password hygiene is a term that describes how healthy and safe your passwords and password related habits are. Youve probably heard the basic rules before. Don't reuse passwords. Make them long. Use letters, numbers, and symbols. A password manager helps you follow these rules. It doesn't just remember passwords for you. Good password manager apps will also suggest strong, secure, unique passwords that are hard to crack. The password manager takes care of password hygiene for you. While its providing convenience, its substantially increasing your business information security in Omaha. In fact, this is worth exploring a little deeper. The World Economic Forum posted an essential study on the matter. If you have an eight digit password that just uses lowercase letters, a malicious attacker can crack it instantaneously. Bump that password up to lowercase letters, and it suddenly takes weeks to crack. Mix in some numbers and symbols and maybe some uppercase letters, and suddenly the same method cant crack your password in the next , years. It doesn't take that much to turn a weak password into a strong one. The problem is that remembering strong passwords is even harder. Thus, the password manager saves the day in more ways than one. Now that you're sold on password managers, how do you actually use one Youve already used something to that effect on your phone, but it doesn't necessarily work with your office computer. Things can get a little hairy and weird. Fortunately, managers are made to simplify life, and you can fully utilize it by learning a handful of easy steps. This seems like a natural place to start. Find a password manager that you like. There are a ton of good ones out there. When you're shopping around, you'll compare the obvious attributes. How much does it cost How hard is it to use many have free trials so you can test that firsthand Does it work with all of your devices Those are all important considerations, but the most important thing to check is extremely easy to overlook. How secure is the password manager Password manager companies devote substantial effort to maintaining their security standards. While using a strong password for the manager is crucial, there's another step that is even more important enabling multifactor authentication MFA for your password manager. If MFA isn't available, its advisable to switch to a different manager. For anyone unclear, MFA is where you put in your password to log into an account, and then you also need to get a temporary security code from a text message or an email. There are other ways to do it too, but the point is that this makes your password manager much, much more secure. Something that can help you understand password managers is learning about the different types Each of these will remember passwords for you, and the vast majority also suggest strong passwords. That said, full feature password management apps are the best way to go for a couple of reasons. First, a browser password manager only works with that one browser. If you use the same browser on all of your devices, it will remember passwords for you across those devices, but it cant remember passwords for apps outside of the browser. That means you need something else to manage those passwords safely. Native device managers tend to run into the same thing Apples Keychain is a prime example. These managers work great on one device such as your phone, but they might not work universally across all of your devices unless you change the settings. Cloud accounts that manage passwords might actually work across all of your devices and apps, but they only work when you have internet access. A full feature app covers all of this. It will work universally on all of your devices. It works whether you're in a browser or using a different app. It does sync across the cloud, but it can also work offline. Its the ultimate solution. With all of that covered, how do you actually use the manager once you pick one They're pretty intuitive, but a quick guide will make sure you're in the know. First, you have to set up the password manager with an account. It will walk you through this when you install it for the first time. That's when you will pick your master password for the manager its the only password you need to remember now. Its also when you set up multifactor authentication. Don't skip that. Once that is done, you can start filling in passwords. Every time you type in a password on a device that has the manager installed, it will offer to remember that password. Even better, you can ask it to suggest a strong password using the password generator feature and update that account record. In fact, this is a good idea. Start with the accounts you use and care about the most, and make sure you have a strong password on each of them. Its ok if it takes a little while to get through your list, but ultimately, you want all of your passwords to be strong and remembered by the manager. From there, as long as you allow the manager to run, it will take care of the rest. It will recommend passwords whenever you create a new account, and it will remember every password indefinitely. It will also automatically update passwords if you have to change them. If you happen to work in a leadership role in your place of business, you might consider standardizing password managers in the workplace. That's a good idea. If you want to ensure that everyone is using the manager to good effect, consider a couple of things. First, pay for a company account for the manager. You can usually get bulk rates to have dozens of users and more if needed. This gets all of your staff on the same manager which makes it easier to support, and it removes any barrier to entry. From there, offer training to use the manager. Many people wont need training, but some might. If that training is available, you get rid of excuses, and everyone wins. That's really it. If you make things easy, people tend to like it. Password managers can do that for you, and you can do that for people in your place of work.

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your organization is by using a password manager, which helps ensure proper password hygiene.

Why Use a Password Manager?
The average person deals with around 100 passwords daily, making it nearly impossible to remember each one securely. This is where a password manager steps in, allowing you to store, retrieve, and generate strong, unique passwords. They significantly enhance security by eliminating the risks associated with reusing weak passwords.

A password manager doesn’t just store passwords—it also helps create secure, complex passwords. For example, an 8-character lowercase password can be cracked instantly by attackers. But by using a password manager to generate a password with a mix of uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers, you can create a password that would take millennia to crack.

How to Choose and Use a Password Manager
When selecting a password manager, consider these key points:

Security: Look for strong encryption and multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is a critical step in ensuring that your password manager is protected.
Ease of use: It should sync across all your devices and work with apps outside your browser, giving you the flexibility to access your passwords no matter where you are.
A full-feature app is the best option since it works seamlessly across devices, including offline, and can manage all passwords, whether they're for websites or apps. Examples include 1Password, LastPass, and Dashlane, which offer robust features such as password generation, secure sharing, and regular updates to ensure compliance with security best practices.

Ensuring Compliance in Your Organization
For businesses, implementing password managers across the company is an excellent way to streamline security practices. Consider:

Providing access to a company account to ensure all staff are on the same system.
Offering training to ensure everyone understands how to use the tool effectively, which can remove barriers to adoption.
By making cybersecurity practices like password management easy and accessible, you help create a more secure environment for your business and its sensitive data.

For more details on password managers and cybersecurity best practices, you can check resources from organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or explore additional reading on password management tools.

https://www.coretech.us/blog/safeguarding-sensitive-data-cybersecurity-tips-for-recruiting-agencies,"Owning or managing a recruiting agency comes with so many opportunities. But for every opportunity, you face a dozen challenges.

Among the greatest of those challenges is cybersecurity, and for a recruiting agency, personal data protection is incredibly important.

If you’re not sure where to start, you’re in the right place. Below, we’ll discuss the top cybersecurity tips for recruiting agencies.

Security Best Practices



Staffing agencies certainly face unique challenges in the world of cybersecurity, but not everything pertains to the industry. The same essential security measures that work for other businesses also apply to recruiting firms and staffing agencies, so that’s the best place to start.

Design a segmented network that mitigates risk if an intrusion occurs. Use firewalls and antivirus software. Stay on top of software updates as they often include security patches.

Perhaps most importantly, modernize your login authentication. Implement strong passwords by utilizing more characters and a wider variety of characters. In fact, standardizing the use of password managers makes it much easier to use a truly strong password for every account. At the same time, each password can be unique, so if one is compromised, it doesn’t create a security risk for other accounts.

In addition, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is important to implement. The additional security MFA provides is significant. Although it may be an additional login step, it’s quick. And according to Microsoft MFA can prevent 99.9% of attacks on your accounts. .

While you deploy essential security tools, be sure to work closely with your IT support provider in Omaha. They can help you prioritize security measures to get you as secure as possible as quickly as possible.

Prioritize Data Protection



Now, with the basic security elements in place, let’s focus on specific security issues facing recruiting agencies.

Recruiters handle more sensitive and personal information than most fields of work, and that data remains on the system while in active use. Protecting that data should always be a top priority..

To that effort, remember these data protection concepts.

First, strict access policies need to be in place. It’s not enough to restrict data access to users within the agency. In most cases, employees at the agency should not have access to all of the data stored by the company. Only give users access to the things they specifically need in their role. Network segmentation (mentioned in the previous section) proves invaluable for data protection. Do not store all of your data in one place, and do not create direct networking highways between the data stores. Instead, segment the network so that any one intrusion cannot access the whole network. This mitigates fallout considerably.

Don’t cut corners on your data backup systems and processes. The industry standard is to maintain three professional backups of your data: the original, a cloud version, and a local backup. This allows you to recover more quickly and reliably in the event of a security breach or ransomware incident.

Lastly, perform regular security audits and bring in professional expertise from your Lincoln or Omaha managed IT provider. Security protection tools are constantly evolving, and the right IT provider will stay on top of changes, as well as communicate best practices.

Implement Ongoing Security Training



Ongoing security training may sound like a lot of effort, however it does not have to be when you know what to train and have the right training tools in place. See our additional resources at the bottom of this blog post.

Agency leadership will want to go through the training first in order to encourage other staff to devote time and energy to learning about IT, security, and data. You don’t have to be a verified expert in the topic, but you need to know enough to recognize good security practices.

Whether in Omaha or anywhere else, one of the best ways to spot valuable IT support services is in the ability of the experts to explain security concepts in relatable and understandable terms. In addition, constant learning helps your team leverage technology security tools within your firm. Is there a CRM platform that helps you manage prospects data? Do you have secure communication lines for recruiters and clients? Do your different apps integrate with each other? How is the data encrypted?

You can see how answering questions like these informs your security strategy. That’s still not the end. You see, most data breaches involve poor practices from someone within the organization. That means that every member of the agency needs training.

Your IT provider in Omaha or Lincoln can build training and resources to help with that, but company-wide buy-in matters here. You need everyone on board, and you will likely have recurring training to block new threats that emerge.

Plan and Plan Some More



Cybersecurity is important to plan for and implement in this time of skilled hackers that target industries and specific roles in an organization. You need a strategy to combat these criminals. You need disaster recovery plans as well, in the event a data breach occurs. In fact, you need clear-cut plans for the whole agency to follow to protect the company data and systems on a daily basis

This is where your technology partner and managed IT provider in Omaha shines the most. They can provide strategic planning services that ensure you cover all the bases.

So, think about data, security, and recruiting. What kinds of data do you need to keep in your systems? How long do you need to keep it? Who needs to access what data?

If you can clearly describe how you use technology, and especially how you use data, you can build and implement a security plan that works best for your business.

Create a Remote Work Strategy



Recruiting work lends itself to remote work at a higher rate than many other industries. If you have absolutely no remote work, you can skip this part. Odds are, remote work is important in your agency, and you need a strategy that protects data even when people remotely connect to your IT resources.

The two primary components of remote work security are secure connections and access control. Make certain you address each of these areas.

On top of that, you need to know your remote work principles and policies. What data and applications do remote employees have access to? How are they accessing the information? Through a VPN or public internet connection? Your remote work policy informs your security strategy, so flesh it out as much as possible as early as possible.

Budget



Every business needs a budget, and modern businesses especially need a cybersecurity budget. For recruiting agencies, it’s crucial to have a well-planned budget that specifically addresses data security and management. Here are some key considerations for enhancing your cybersecurity budget:

Allocate for Regular Security Audits: Schedule periodic security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards.



Invest in Advanced Security Tools: Budget for state-of-the-art firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to protect sensitive data.



Employee Training Programs: Allocate funds for ongoing cybersecurity training for all employees to prevent internal security breaches.



Backup Solutions: Ensure you have robust backup solutions in place, including cloud-based and local backups, to quickly recover from potential data loss.



Incident Response Plan: Set aside funds for developing and maintaining an incident response plan, including resources for immediate action during a security breach.



Software and Hardware Updates: Regularly update all software and hardware to the latest versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.



Consulting Services : Budget for consulting services from cybersecurity experts to stay ahead of emerging threats and implement best practices.



Cybersecurity Insurance: Invest in comprehensive cybersecurity insurance to cover potential liabilities and recovery costs in the event of a breach.





By earmarking a portion of your budget for these critical areas, you can ensure your recruiting agency remains secure and resilient against cyber threats.

Consider Cybersecurity Business Insurance



This is the last tip! Any company that handles personal data needs to have cybersecurity insurance just for malicious IT attacks.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but perfect security doesn’t exist. Firms that contain more personal data than your average business have a target on their backs.

Cybersecurity insurance can help you with liability issues that are tied to a data breach. Insurance can also help you take the necessary steps to identify how the breach occurred. Your managed IT services provider will help you recover from data backups and remove any viruses or malware in place.

Insurance provides the final layer of protection, and with it, you are in a better position to recover from a cybersecurity incident.
","Cybersecurity is a significant concern for recruiting agencies, as they manage sensitive personal data that makes them prime targets for cyberattacks. To protect this data, agencies must implement a combination of security measures, such as network segmentation, firewalls, antivirus software, and regular software updates. A crucial part of securing access to agency systems involves modernizing login authentication with strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and utilizing password managers to ensure unique, complex passwords for every account. MFA has been shown to prevent a significant percentage of attacks, adding an essential layer of protection.

In addition to securing access, recruiting agencies must adopt strict data protection practices, including limiting employee access to only the information needed for their roles. This can be reinforced through network segmentation, which prevents a single breach from compromising the entire system. Agencies should also maintain multiple backups of their data (cloud, local, and original) to ensure quick recovery in case of a breach or ransomware attack. Regular security audits and ongoing training for employees are also key to mitigating risks from human error, which is often a significant factor in data breaches.

For agencies with remote workers, secure connections and access control are paramount. A well-defined remote work policy that includes the use of VPNs and restricted data access ensures that data remains secure even when accessed remotely. Agencies should also allocate a portion of their budget to cybersecurity, with a focus on data protection, disaster recovery, and insurance to cover liabilities in the event of a data breach. Cybersecurity insurance provides an added layer of protection by helping with recovery efforts and identifying how breaches occur, ensuring that the agency is better prepared for potential incidents.","1.

httpswwwcrowdstrikecomen-usblog5-crucial-steps-to-protect-your-resources-in-google-cloud,"Securing the cloud has become increasingly complex as organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud resources to meet their demanding business requirements. It’s also more crucial than ever: From 2022 to 2023, CrowdStrike identified a 75% increase in cloud intrusions.

As organizations migrate their workloads and assets to the Cloud, they must take the necessary steps to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance across their Google Cloud environments. While Google Cloud is responsible for securing the infrastructure on which its services run, the organizations relying on this infrastructure are responsible for protecting their data within Google Cloud services — a process that includes crucial steps such as implementing access controls, encrypting data and monitoring for threats across the cloud.

It’s this customer responsibility we examine in this blog post. Here, we highlight five best practices for securing Google Cloud resources, with a focus on how CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security helps you strengthen your cloud security posture along the way.

1. Implement Strong Identity and Access Management

Identity has become a primary target for adversaries — and a crucial area of concern for organizations. The CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report states 75% of attacks were malware-free in 2023, with stolen credentials a key point of entry. It’s clear that proper identity and access management (IAM) is the foundation of cloud security. Key IAM practices include creating and managing user roles, permissions and access controls to ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive resources.

Key strategies include:

Principle of least privilege (POLP) : Grant users the minimum level of access necessary for their roles. Periodic evaluations should be planned to reduce access levels when they are no longer necessary.

: Grant users the minimum level of access necessary for their roles. Periodic evaluations should be planned to reduce access levels when they are no longer necessary. Multi Factor authentication (MFA) : Best MFA practices add an extra layer of security. Implement session time limits, enforce robust password policies and require regular password changes. Verify that MFA connections originate from a trusted source or IP range.

httpswwwdigitalguardiancomresourcesknowledge-baseransomware-protection-best-practices-tips-and-solutions,"Data Security Knowledge Base Ransomware is a type of crypto malware used for cyber extortion. Ransomware holds a victims computer or their files hostage via encryption while demanding payment in exchange for decrypting the files and releasing access to the users device. Ransomware is usually spread through phishing attacks containing a malicious email attachment, infected program, or link to a compromised website. Ransomware attacks have evolved to target businesses, encrypting entire networks of computers or files and bringing business operations to a halt until the ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks have extorted millions from end users and businesses in , prompting the FBI to release an advisory on the growing ransomware threat in April. Once a system becomes infected and the computer is locked and files encrypted, the user is unable to use the needed features of their computer. Typically, when a user first attempts to use an infected machine, a popup window appears notifying them that they must pay a certain amount of money to reclaim their device and associated data. Some ransomware programs, or the cybercriminals behind them, impersonate government or police agencies in an attempt to intimidate victims, claiming there are security reasons that the computer was shut down and insisting a fee or fine must be paid. With attacks on the rise, businesses and individuals should be aware of ransomware attack techniques and follow best practices for ransomware protection. There are several ways that enterprises and their employees can play a role in protecting the company's sensitive data from ransomware attacks, such as This is the first line of defense against ransomware. As ransomware is commonly introduced through email attachments and links, arming employees with the knowledge they need to practice secure email and browsing habits can prevent many ransomware attacks from succeeding. Train employees on how to recognize phishing attacks as well as best practices such as not opening attachments or links in emails from unknown senders, checking link URLs, and never clicking popup windows. Training should be ongoing rather than a single session to ensure that employees keep up with new threats and maintain secure habits. Having diligent data backup processes in place can limit the damage caused by a ransomware attack significantly, as encrypted data can be restored without paying a ransom. Granting unlimited access to networks and software applications is not only hazardous to the organizations security posture but can also lead to a multitude of errors and other mishaps resulting from employees using programs or features they don't require access to. Configure employee accounts with only the access privileges required for their job roles. Software updates typically contain patches for security vulnerabilities and should be installed as soon as they're made available. Enable automatic updates whenever possible to streamline this process. These are features that aren't necessary for most employees yet can be exploited by attackers to spread ransomware and other forms of malware. Paying the ransom only establishes you as a paying target for future attacks and has even led to follow-on data breaches at some organizations. Unless you have absolutely no other choice, avoid paying ransoms. In addition to following the best practices listed above, businesses should consider implementing ransomware protection solutions to improve their systems defenses against ransomware attacks. Ransomware protection reliant on signature based security methods are largely ineffective, as new ransomware programs are being developed all the time. Today ransomware protection requires a multipronged approach that combines user education with solutions for ransomware prevention and detection. Solutions like advanced threat protection or endpoint detection and response provide behavior based detection and blocking of ransomware attacks that go beyond the limitations of signature based detection of known malware. Additionally, many enterprises implement application whitelisting to bolster ransomware protection efforts. This solution allows only specified applications to run, reducing the risk of ransomware programs executing on local machines.","Ransomware is a form of malicious software (malware) that encrypts a victim's files or entire system, effectively locking them out of their own data until a ransom is paid. Typically, ransomware is delivered via phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that lead to compromised websites. Once the ransomware infects a system, it encrypts files and displays a ransom note demanding payment, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.

Ransomware attacks have grown significantly, shifting from targeting individuals to larger-scale attacks on businesses. These attacks can cripple entire networks, halt operations, and cost businesses millions in ransom payments, as well as lost productivity. The FBI has issued advisories warning of the increasing ransomware threat, particularly after high-profile incidents in 2016.

In some cases, cybercriminals behind ransomware attacks impersonate government or law enforcement agencies, attempting to intimidate victims with fake fines or legal threats, further pressuring them to comply with the ransom demands. As the frequency of these attacks increases, both businesses and individuals need to adopt robust security practices to protect against ransomware, including cautious handling of email attachments, regular backups, and the use of up-to-date antivirus software.

https://www.digitalguardian.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-social-engineering-defining-and-avoiding-common-social-engineering-threats,"Data Security Knowledge Base Social engineering is a nontechnical strategy cyber attackers use that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices. The success of social engineering techniques depends on attackers ability to manipulate victims into performing certain actions or providing confidential information. Today, social engineering is recognized as one of the greatest security threats facing organizations. Social engineering differs from traditional hacking in the sense that social engineering attacks can be nontechnical and don't necessarily involve the compromise or exploitation of software or systems. When successful, many social engineering attacks enable attackers to gain legitimate, authorized access to confidential information. Social engineers are a modern day form of fraudsters or con artists. They may attempt to access computer networks or data stores by gaining the confidence of authorized users or stealing those users credentials in order to masquerade as trusted insiders. It is common for social engineers to rely on the natural helpfulness of people or to attempt to exploit their perceived personality weaknesses. For example, they may call with a feigned urgent problem that requires immediate network access. Social engineers have been known to appeal to vanity, authority, greed, or other information gleaned from eavesdropping or online sleuthing, often via social media. Cyber criminals use social engineering tactics in order to convince people to open email attachments infected with malware, persuade unsuspecting individuals to divulge sensitive information, or even scare people into installing and running malware. Your organization should take steps toward educating employees on the common types of social engineering attacks, including baiting, phishing, pretexting, quid pro quo, spear phishing, and tailgating. While there are technological solutions that help mitigate social engineering such as email filters, firewalls, and network or data monitoring tools, having an employee base that is able to recognize and avoid common social engineering tactics is ultimately the best defense against these schemes. Here is a breakdown of common social engineering techniques Attackers conduct baiting attacks when they leave a malware infected device, such as a USB flash drive or CD, in a place where someone likely will find it. The success of a baiting attack hinges on the notion that the person who finds the device will load it into their computer and unknowingly install the malware. Once installed, the malware allows the attacker to advance into the victims system. Phishing occurs when an attacker makes fraudulent communications with a victim that are disguised as legitimate, often claiming or seeming to be from a trusted source. In a phishing attack the recipient is tricked into installing malware on their device or sharing personal, financial, or business information. Email is the most popular mode of communication for phishing attacks, but phishing may also utilize chat applications, social media, phone calls, or spoofed websites designed to look legitimate. Some of the worst phishing attacks make charity pleas after natural disasters or tragedies strike, exploiting peoples goodwill and urging them to donate to a cause by inputting personal or payment information. Pretexting occurs when an attacker fabricates false circumstances to compel a victim into providing access to sensitive data or protected systems. Examples of pretexting attacks include a scammer pretending to need financial data in order to confirm the identity of the recipient or masquerading as a trusted entity such as a member of the company's IT department in order to trick the victim into divulging login credentials or granting computer access. A quid pro quo attack occurs when attackers request private information from someone in exchange for something desirable or some type of compensation. For instance, an attacker requests login credentials in exchange for a free gift. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Spear phishing is a highly targeted type of phishing attack that focuses on a specific individual or organization. Spear phishing attacks use personal information that is specific to the recipient in order gain trust and appear more legitimate. Often times this information is taken from victims social media accounts or other online activity. By personalizing their phishing tactics, spear phishers have higher success rates for tricking victims into granting access or divulging sensitive information such as financial data or trade secrets. Tailgating is a physical social engineering technique that occurs when unauthorized individuals follow authorized individuals into an otherwise secure location. The goal of tailgating is to obtain valuable property or confidential information. Tailgating could occur when someone asks you to hold the door open because they forgot their access card or asks to borrow your phone or laptop to complete a simple task and instead installs malware or steals data. Social engineering is a serious and ongoing threat for many organizations and individual consumers who fall victim to these cons. Social engineering awareness is the first step in preventing your organization from falling victim to savvy attackers employing increasingly sophisticated social engineering methods to gain access to sensitive data. ","Social engineers are individuals who exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or resources. They are modern fraudsters who rely on manipulating or deceiving people rather than relying on technical hacking methods. By gaining the trust of authorized users or stealing their credentials, they can infiltrate computer networks or data stores.

Common tactics used by social engineers include exploiting the natural helpfulness of people, preying on their weaknesses, or using psychological triggers like urgency or fear. For example, they might pose as an IT technician or another trusted authority figure, creating a fabricated emergency that requires immediate access to sensitive systems. They may also exploit personal characteristics such as vanity, authority, or greed, which they often glean through social media or online research.

Social engineering attacks can manifest in various forms, such as phishing emails designed to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments, phone calls where criminals impersonate trusted colleagues or company representatives, or even scare tactics to convince victims to install malware on their devices. These attacks highlight the importance of awareness and caution when interacting with unfamiliar sources, whether online or offline, to avoid falling victim to these deceptive tactics.

31. Baiting involves luring victims into performing an action, such as inserting a USB drive or downloading a file, by offering something desirable in exchange, often resulting in malware installation.  
32. In baiting, attackers use physical media, like infected USB drives or CDs, to tempt the victim into plugging the device into their system, which installs malware or gives unauthorized access to the system.  
33. Social engineering can compromise internal security by exploiting employees' trust or lack of awareness, enabling attackers to bypass security measures and gain access to restricted systems or sensitive information.  
34. Tailgating is effective because it relies on a victim’s politeness or assumption of the attacker’s legitimacy, allowing the unauthorized person to follow an authorized individual into a secure location.  
35. Social engineering manipulates trust and authority by impersonating figures of power, such as an IT administrator or company executive, to influence victims into revealing confidential information.  
36. Urgency is often used to pressure individuals into taking immediate actions without fully evaluating the situation, such as opening suspicious emails or sharing sensitive data quickly to resolve a supposed emergency.  
37. Quid pro quo is when an attacker offers something in exchange for sensitive information, like a free service or reward in return for login credentials or access to confidential systems.  
38. Impersonation is a social engineering tactic where attackers pretend to be someone the victim knows or trusts, such as a colleague, customer service agent, or company executive, to gain sensitive information.  
39. Social media is often used by attackers to gather personal information about victims, which is then used to craft more convincing attacks like spear phishing or pretexting.  
40. Smishing is a form of phishing that uses SMS text messages to trick victims into revealing personal information or downloading malware by clicking on a link or replying to the message.  
41. Vishing, or voice phishing, involves using phone calls to impersonate a legitimate entity, such as a bank or government agency, in order to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to systems.  
42. Employees can avoid phishing attacks by being cautious about unsolicited emails, verifying the source of messages before clicking links or downloading attachments, and looking for signs of suspicious or unusual content.  
43. Red flags of phishing emails include poor grammar, suspicious sender addresses, urgent or threatening language, unexpected attachments, and requests for sensitive personal information.  
44. Companies can train employees to spot social engineering tactics by conducting regular security awareness sessions, running simulated phishing exercises, and emphasizing the importance of caution with emails and phone calls.

https://www.facebook.com/business/news/business-security-measures,"By Jeff King, VP Business Integrity As cybercrimes and scams become more sophisticated across the internet, its crucial to stay a step ahead of those trying to harm businesses and people on our technologies. More than million businesses connect with their customers through Meta, and our proactive security measures help protect those valuable relationships. To help ensure that businesses can safely connect with people, we make security a fundamental part of everything we do. We are continually improving through the development of new tools, technologies and teams to detect and mitigate security risks. Today we have , people working on safety and security, and we have invested more than billion in teams and technology in this area since . Meta employs a defense in depth approach to security, layering multiple levels of protection to help prevent and address vulnerabilities through key areas promoting authentic connections, increasing account security and delivering accountability. Through our proactive measures, we restrict the vast majority of attacks, but its not possible to stop every incident before it occurs. For those attacks that aren't caught upfront, we have processes in place to tackle and resolve them quickly. People want to know that the brands they interact with on our technologies are legitimate. We rely on a variety of tools, including our verification process, to protect legitimate businesses and stop entities that want to do harm, thus enabling people to form authentic connections with businesses they can trust. We require many businesses to undergo verification to confirm the identities of the business and its representatives before they can use certain tools or features. We've designed our systems and verification requirements to reflect the varied sizes, complexities and audiences of the businesses and organizations that use our technology. Verification requirements include activities such as Our second major focus is on increasing account security protections to help prevent unauthorized access to businesses accounts. Two factor identification We require all large global business users to use two factor authentication to access our business products such as Meta Business Suite, which includes Pages Manager, Ads Manager and Business Manager interfaces. This is intended to help mitigate the risk of unauthorized activity like someone else adding or removing users or creating ads. Businesses have options for enabling two factor authentication on an account security keys, third-party authentication apps and text message SMS codes. To further protect business accounts, we limit the ability to take actions in Business Manager such as adding or removing users, accessing credit lines or creating ads or pixels when two factor authentication is not enabled. Machine learning detection Our systems also use machine learning detection to proactively flag signs of suspicious behavior such as unusual spend changes in advertising campaigns and unusual logins from unexpected Internet Protocol IP addresses, devices or physical locations to our teams for further investigation. In instances where we detect suspicious activities, our teams use streamlined recovery processes so businesses with a suspected compromise experience the shortest possible downtime. Additionally, we continue to automate security best practices in our systems, such as setting up automatic account logouts triggered with inactivity. Easier account management for businesses For an added layer of security, businesses routinely tell us they are looking for access to our business products through separate credentials from their personal Facebook accounts. For this, were building Work Accounts, which will allow business users to log in and operate Business Manager without requiring a personal account. Businesses will be able to manage these accounts on behalf of their employees and have access to features like integration with a company's existing single sign on capabilities, giving them more control over the security of their employees accounts. After an initial round of product testing with select businesses, we are currently investing in product improvements ahead of a launch for all clients. We also hold everyone on our technologies accountable through a comprehensive set of measures to monitor for and enforce penalties against policy violations through our standard ad review process. We monitor businesses activities on our technologies at both an account and transaction level for suspicious behavior. In addition, we have tools that help identify malicious activity that may extend beyond our platform such as links embedded in ads that may lead to fraudulent websites or other bad experiences click to products or experiences using mobile app integrity and landing page review tools. When violations are found, our teams consider a variety of actions including disapproving violating ads, disabling malicious accounts, working with local law enforcement or taking legal action against scammers. We also use various machine learning systems and models that help us determine the likely risk of businesses violating our policies based on past activities and engagement, and we can then monitor high risk situations more closely. We are continuously upgrading our systems to monitor activity and enforce our policies. This includes our efforts to deliver more trustworthy shopping experiences for people and businesses through commerce policies and safety measures. Businesses can also play a role in keeping their accounts protected. Business owners looking for proactive ways to strengthen security can review our best practices for businesses guide for help with safeguarding personal and business accounts. This includes recommendations on enabling two factor identification and other account protections, turning on notifications to be alerted to suspicious activity and monitoring ads and spending through a weekly report. Together, we can protect the valuable connections our partners have made with their customers on our technologies. We know that security work is never finished. Scammers will develop new techniques and well continue to innovate and address evolving threats. This includes ongoing work to improve our security features and detection mechanisms to identify and prevent malicious activity before they affect a business connection with customers. As we move into an increasingly complex digital landscape, we will continue to prioritize security while building trustworthy environments for the future of business.","As cybercrimes and scams become more sophisticated, Meta has implemented proactive security measures to protect businesses and their customers. With over a billion businesses interacting through Meta's platforms, the company has made security a core focus, investing billions in teams and technologies to detect and mitigate risks. Meta employs a ""defense in depth"" strategy, layering multiple levels of protection across its systems to safeguard business accounts and maintain the integrity of interactions between businesses and users. Despite efforts to prevent attacks, Meta recognizes that some incidents may occur, and it has processes in place to address and resolve them quickly.

One of Meta's key security initiatives is business verification, requiring businesses to confirm their identities before accessing certain tools. This helps ensure that users can trust the brands they interact with. Additionally, Meta strengthens account security by requiring large global business users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for accessing business tools. This measure helps prevent unauthorized access and activities, such as adding or removing users or creating ads. Meta also uses machine learning to detect suspicious behavior, such as unusual spending in advertising campaigns or logins from unexpected locations, and swiftly investigates potential threats. Automated systems like account logouts after inactivity further enhance security.

To improve security and ease account management, Meta is developing ""Work Accounts"" to allow business users to operate Business Manager without linking to personal Facebook accounts. This will give businesses greater control over employee account security and integrate with existing single sign-on systems. Additionally, Meta enforces accountability through a robust ad review process, monitoring accounts for suspicious behavior and malicious activity, such as links in ads leading to fraudulent websites. Penalties for policy violations include disabling accounts, disapproving ads, and collaborating with law enforcement when necessary.

Meta encourages businesses to adopt best practices for securing their accounts, such as enabling 2FA, monitoring ad spending, and setting up notifications for suspicious activity. The company continues to innovate, addressing evolving cyber threats and reinforcing security measures to protect business connections with customers in a complex digital landscape.","1.

https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2017/05/10/the-cyberpoppers-the-security-fix-and-the-other-guys/,"Cyber popping is a term I coined for the lack of a better word to describe any vague and most of the time responsibility free activity that is either used andor abused to sell and market IT security in whatever form and shape possible. Yup, the activity where the seller is not being necessarily responsible for overseeing that security to the remediation closure assurance phase. We all practice it. There are various cyber poppers out there At every step of this journey the ego and schadenfreude prevails. We all know better. And anytime we find something new and cool, the Champagne cork pops and we get the fix. I love it, you love it. We are one big family of security enfants terrible As I get older though and get more and more insight into the less flashy part of the security world one where the security is actually being implemented it becomes more and more apparent to me that none of these things really help the Other guys. If you watched the movie you know who I am talking about. These poor creatures that sit in the backend offices, spend hours on the calls, actually talk to business people and clients, speak to nontechnical people, and ensure the stuff that we are all breaking, or talk about breaking is actually fixed. This is not a fun job, its error-prone, it ricochets when they screw up it often costs big bucks, it is long hours, and on calls where the big decisions are made. I just want to take the moment today to say thank you to all engineers, admins, firewall guys, architects, customer facing security guys, vulnerability management teams, and ISOs and any other guys who actually deal with the _real_ world aspects of IT security.","The term cyberpopping is a critique of the IT security industry, used to describe the broad, often vague activities that are marketed or sold as solutions, but which lack true accountability or effective implementation. These activities are typically used by vendors and cybersecurity companies to generate attention and sales, without necessarily following through on their promises of securing systems or addressing threats to completion.

Cyberpopping covers a range of activities, including things like 0days (undiscovered vulnerabilities), Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), data dumps, and various types of certifications, compliance requirements, or even conferences. The term also touches on the role of social media, where influencers and bloggers might contribute to hype about security topics without fully addressing the technical, behind-the-scenes work that is required for actual, sustained security implementation.

While these activities and terms often make the industry feel exciting and full of innovation, they can be seen as distractions or marketing tools that don’t always solve real-world problems. The other guys, the ones working in the trenches—engineers, administrators, vulnerability management teams—are the ones doing the hard work to ensure security vulnerabilities are actually fixed and remediated. The post acknowledges the lack of glamour in this work, which often involves long hours, dealing with non-technical users, and facing significant consequences when mistakes are made.

This acknowledgment is a tribute to those who are less visible but essential to the ongoing, day-to-day battle for cybersecurity in organizations. It emphasizes the difference between the hype-driven parts of the cybersecurity world and the practical, often thankless labor that goes into securing systems and protecting data.

The concept draws attention to the broader industry trends while advocating for a more grounded view of the actual efforts that drive meaningful security outcomes.","1. What is cyberpopping?

wwwibmcomtopicscybersecurity,"Published August Contributors Gregg Lindemulder, Matt Kosinski Cybersecurity refers to any technologies, practices and policies for preventing cyberattacks or mitigating their impact. Cybersecurity aims to protect computer systems, applications, devices, data, financial assets and people against ransomware and other malware, phishing scams, data theft and other cyberthreats. At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is a key component of an organizations overall risk management strategy. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global spending on cybersecurity products and services will exceed USD . trillion total during the years through . Cybersecurity job growth is also robust. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of information security analysts is projected to grow from to , faster than the average for all occupations. Get essential insights to help your security and IT teams better manage risk and limit potential losses. Register for the XForce Threat Intelligence Index Cybersecurity is important because cyberattacks and cybercrime have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses, communities and lives. Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of sensitive information and business critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in some cases, business closures. Cyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD . trillion per year by . The cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals become more sophisticated. According to IBMs latest Cost of a Data Breach Report Apart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the ever evolving nature of the information technology IT landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example As the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap the gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled might reach million workers by . Closing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the Cost of a Data Breach Report, organizations suffering from a high level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD . million, compared to USD . million for organizations with lower level skills shortages. Resources trained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, artificial intelligence AI and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks. Comprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organizations IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include AI security refers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways. Generative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can also use and have already used generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails. AI security uses specialized risk management frameworks and increasingly, AI enabled cybersecurity tools to protect the AI attack surface. According to the Cost of a Data Breach Report, organizations that deployed AI enabled security tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD . million lower average cost per breach compared to organizations with no AI deployed. Critical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure. The US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA also provides guidance. Network security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs. Application security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as DevOps and DevSecOps build security and security testing into the development process. Cloud security secures an organizations cloud based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure. Generally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud. Information security InfoSec protects an organizations important information digital files and data, paper documents, physical media against unauthorized access, use or alteration. Data security, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity related InfoSec measures. Mobile security encompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management MAM and enterprise mobility management EMM. More recently, organizations are adopting unified endpoint management UEM solutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console. Some of the most common types of cyberthreats include Malware, short for malicious software, is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware. Hackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money see Ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victims data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted or worse unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker. The earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victims data. Starting around , almost all ransomware attacks were double extortion attacks that also threatened to publicly share victims data some triple extortion attacks added the threat of a distributed denial of service DDoS attack. More recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the IBM XForce Threat Intelligence Index , ransomware attacks accounted for of all attacks in , down . from . The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom. In the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including info stealer malware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victims systems and data destruction attacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes. Phishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people. Most users are familiar with bulk phishing scamsmassmailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as spear phishing and business email compromise BEC, target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money. Phishing is just one type of social engineering, a class of human hacking tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions. The XForce Threat Intelligence Index found that identity based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for of attacks. This makes identity based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks. Hackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In , the IBM XForce team experienced a increase in Kerberoasting incidents. Similarly, the XForce team saw a increase in the use of info stealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data. Insider threats are threats that originate with authorized users employees, contractors, business partners who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals. Insider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks. Much like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks. In generative AI fraud, scammers use generative AI to produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money. The XForce Threat Intelligence Index reports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers hours to come up with the same message manually. Hackers are also using organizations AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse. Crypto jacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero. Security analysts identified crypto jacking as a cyberthreat around , shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM XForce Threat Intelligence Index, crypto jacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals. A DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote controlled operations. The global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom. Despite an ever increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include Strong passwords do make a difference for example, a character password takes trillion times longer to crack than a character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them. In fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach keep increasing. Cybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology OT, Internet of Things IoT devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble. Every industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, .gov websites and critical infrastructure have also increased. Yes, they do. The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report found that almost half of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year. While each organizations cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress Security awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions from using the same simple password for multiple logins to oversharing on social media increase their own or their organizations risk of attack. Combined with thought out data security policies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks. Data security tools, such as encryption and data loss prevention DLP solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them. Identity and access management IAM refers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources. IAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example, multifactor authentication requires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account. Likewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the lateral movement of hackers who make it into the system. A zero trust architecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data. Attack surface management ASM is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organizations attack surface. Unlike other cyber defense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hackers perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker. Analytics and AI driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include security information and event management SIEM, security orchestration, automation and response SOAR and endpoint detection and response EDR. Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal incident response plan. Disaster recovery capabilities can play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup that is hosted in a remote location can help a business resume operations after a ransomware attack sometimes without paying a ransom Transform your business and manage risk with cybersecurity consulting, cloud and managed security services.

As technology evolves, so do the tactics, techniques, and procedures of cybercriminals, who exploit emerging trends to launch more sophisticated attacks.

The widespread adoption of cloud computing has increased the complexity of network management, as misconfigurations, insecure APIs, and other vulnerabilities become potential entry points for hackers. Similarly, the shift toward remote work, hybrid work environments, and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies means more devices, applications, and data are connected to networks, making them harder to secure effectively. The growing proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many of which come with default security flaws or no security at all, creates additional risk. These devices can be easily hijacked by attackers to infiltrate systems.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, presents a new frontier of threats. Cybercriminals are already exploiting AI to manipulate systems, using methods like prompt injection to bypass security protocols. Alarmingly, research from the IBM® Institute for Business Value revealed that only a quarter of generative AI projects are adequately secured, further expanding the attack surface.

Adding to the problem is a significant skills gap in cybersecurity. The World Economic Forum predicts a shortfall of 85 million cybersecurity professionals by 2030, leaving many organizations vulnerable. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations facing severe cybersecurity workforce shortages experience breaches that cost nearly 44% more than those with a better-skilled workforce. This highlights the importance of not only increasing the cybersecurity workforce but also investing in advanced technologies such as AI, automation, and analytics to help mitigate these risks. As security teams struggle with limited resources, these tools are becoming essential in strengthening defenses and reducing the impact of successful attacks.","1.

","After major cyber attacks or data breaches, cybersecurity companies and professionals universally face the question, How would you have detected or prevented this type of attack This week, the question is related to the Snowflake data breach. Security analysts at Mandiant have reported a significant data breach affecting hundreds of Snowflake cloud storage customers. Snowflake is a cloud based data platform that provides a single place for data storage, processing, and analytics. It is available on public clouds like Amazon Web Services AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, making it considered cloud agnostic. The primary issue in this case appears to have been a lack of proper security controls on the victim Snowflake instances no MFA, open network ACL, no requirement to change passwords, which enabled the use of previously compromised credentials. While technically fixable, this is another high-profile incident affected by fundamental security issues. The incident underscores the critical importance of leveraging proactive threat intelligence to detect novel and evolving cyber threats before they can launch campaigns using vulnerabilities like missing Multifactor Authentication MFA. Info stealers are a type of malware designed to infiltrate systems and steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and other personal information. These tools are often deployed via phishing emails or malicious websites and can evade traditional security measures. According to Mandiant's analysis, info stealer activity related to this breach dates back to . The threat actors accessed credentials from various info stealer campaigns, successfully infecting systems, executing their malware, and exfiltrating data for multiple victims. They bypassed traditional defenses such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems IDS, and endpoint protections, transmitting stolen data to Command and Control C servers. This highlights the importance of network based detections and proactive threat intelligence, which can effectively detect such activities and add an essential layer of security to the overall cyber ecosystem. Malware typically requires external communication to a Command and Control C server to receive additional instructions, maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, etc. Knowing the adversary C servers provides critical information applicable to a majority of cyber attacks. Iron Radar is designed to proactively detect and neutralize such threats by identifying and monitoring C servers. Iron Radar currently tracks information stealer frameworks, and since the beginning of this year, over info stealer indicators have been distributed to our customers across the Collective Defense community. This proactive approach ensures that threats are identified and mitigated before they can cause significant harm. Reflecting on these types of attacks, blog posts and technical debriefs often contain indicators of compromise IoCs which are quickly implemented across the industry. While helpful, this is a reactionary response and requires one or more victims to educate the industry. Collective Defense and Proactive Threat Intelligence are increasingly valuable in bridging the gaps of a community that gets its information post compromise days to months depending on the victim organization and disclosure requirements. To answer the question, how would Iron Net detect and respond to the Snowflake data breach Attackers are always a step ahead. They know what technology and detections are commercially available and focus their efforts on evading them. Through our Collective Defense community and Proactive Threat Intelligence, we are enabling our customers to bridge that gap. The bigger we grow, the more power we have. An attack against one is an attack against all.","The Snowflake data breach highlights critical cybersecurity issues that allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities such as the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), open network ACLs, and failure to enforce password changes. These gaps enabled attackers to use previously compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access. The breach underscores the importance of proactive security measures like MFA and threat intelligence, which can help detect and mitigate cyberattacks before they escalate. It also reveals the growing sophistication of cybercriminals who bypass traditional security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint protections.

The breach was linked to info stealer malware, which infiltrated systems through phishing campaigns and malicious websites. These tools are designed to steal sensitive data, including login credentials and financial information, and can bypass conventional defenses. Once infected, systems communicate with Command and Control (C&C) servers to exfiltrate data and maintain persistence. The importance of identifying and monitoring C&C servers is emphasized, as they provide valuable insights into adversary activities. Proactive solutions like Iron Radar track info stealer frameworks, enabling earlier detection and prevention of attacks.

While traditional reactive responses, such as using indicators of compromise (IoCs), help identify threats post-compromise, they are not sufficient to prevent breaches. The growing importance of Collective Defense and Proactive Threat Intelligence is highlighted, as these approaches enable organizations to share threat data and enhance their defenses before attacks occur. Iron Net’s proactive model focuses on early detection through community collaboration, ensuring that attacks against one organization are mitigated across the entire community.","1.

httpswwwmicrosoftcomen-insecuritybusinesssecurity-101what-is-cybersecurity,"Learn about cybersecurity and how to defend your people, data, and applications against todays growing number of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity is a set of processes, best practices, and technology solutions that help protect your critical systems and network from digital attacks. As data has proliferated and more people work and connect from anywhere, bad actors have responded by developing sophisticated methods for gaining access to your resources and stealing data, sabotaging your business, or extorting money. Every year the number of attacks increases, and adversaries develop new methods of evading detection. An effective cybersecurity program includes people, processes, and technology solutions that together reduce the risk of business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage from an attack. Malware is a catchall term for any malicious software, including worms, ransomware, spyware, and viruses. It is designed to cause harm to computers or networks by altering or deleting files, extracting sensitive data like passwords and account numbers, or sending malicious emails or traffic. Malware may be installed by an attacker who gains access to the network, but often, individuals unwittingly deploy malware on their devices or company network after clicking on a bad link or downloading an infected attachment. Ransomware is a form of extortion that uses malware to encrypt files, making them inaccessible. Attackers often extract data during a ransomware attack and may threaten to publish it if they don't receive payment. In exchange for a decryption key, victims must pay a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency. Not all decryption keys work, so payment does not guarantee that the files will be recovered. Social Engineering In social engineering, attackers take advantage of peoples trust to dupe them into handing over account information or downloading malware. In these attacks, bad actors masquerade as a known brand, coworker, or friend and use psychological techniques such as creating a sense of urgency to get people to do what they want. Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses emails, text messages, or voicemails that appear to be from a reputable source to convince people to give up sensitive information or click on an unfamiliar link. Some phishing campaigns are sent to a huge number of people in the hope that one person will click. Other campaigns, called spear phishing, are more targeted and focus on a single person. For example, an adversary might pretend to be a job seeker to trick a recruiter into downloading an infected resume. Insider threats In an insider threat, people who already have access to some systems, such as employees, contractors, or customers, cause a security breach or financial loss. In some cases, this harm is unintentional, such as when an employee accidentally posts sensitive information to a personal cloud account. But some insiders act maliciously. Advanced persistent threat In an advanced persistent threat, attackers gain access to systems but remain undetected over an extended period of time. Adversaries research the target company's systems and steal data without triggering any defensive countermeasures. Todays world is more connected than ever before. The global economy depends on people communicating across time zones and accessing important information from anywhere. Cybersecurity enables productivity and innovation by giving people the confidence to work and socialize online. The right solutions and processes allow businesses and governments to take advantage of technology to improve how they communicate and deliver services without increasing the risk of attack. Adopt a Zero Trust security strategy With more organizations adopting hybrid work models that give employees the flexibility to work in the office and remotely, a new security model is needed that protects people, devices, apps, and data no matter where they're located. A Zero Trust framework starts with the principle that you can no longer trust an access request, even if it comes from inside the network. To mitigate your risk, assume you've been breached and explicitly verify all access requests. Employ least privilege access to give people access only to the resources they need and nothing more. Conduct regular cybersecurity training Cybersecurity is not just the responsibility of security professionals. Today, people use work and personal devices interchangeably, and many cyberattacks start with a phishing email directed at an employee. Even large, well resourced companies are falling prey to social engineering campaigns. Confronting cybercriminals requires that everyone works together to make the online world safer. Teach your team how to safeguard their personal devices and help them recognize and stop attacks with regular training. Monitor effectiveness of your program with phishing simulations. Institute cybersecurity processes To reduce your risk from cyberattacks, develop processes that help you prevent, detect, and respond to an attack. Regularly patch software and hardware to reduce vulnerabilities and provide clear guidelines to your team, so they know what steps to take if you are attacked. You don't have to create your process from scratch. Get guidance from cybersecurity frameworks such as the International Organization for Standardization SOC or the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST. Invest in comprehensive solutions Technology solutions that help address security issues improve every year. Many cybersecurity solutions use AI and automation to detect and stop attacks automatically without human intervention. Other technology helps you make sense of what's going on in your environment with analytics and insights.

Many organizations, including Microsoft, are instituting a Zero Trust security strategy to help protect remote and hybrid workforces that need to securely access company resources from anywhere. Cybersecurity management is a combination of tools, processes, and people. Start by identifying your assets and risks, then create the processes for eliminating or mitigating cybersecurity threats. Develop a plan that guides teams in how to respond if you are breached. Use a solution like Microsoft Secure Score to monitor your goals and assess your security posture. Cybersecurity provides a foundation for productivity and innovation. The right solutions support the way people work today, allowing them to easily access resources and connect with each other from anywhere without increasing the risk of attack. Cyber hygiene is a set of routines that reduce your risk of attack. It includes principles, like least privilege access and multifactor authentication, that make it harder for unauthorized people to gain access. It also includes regular practices, such as patching software and backing up data, that reduce system vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity is a set of processes, best practices, and technology solutions that help protect your critical systems and data from unauthorized access. An effective program reduces the risk of business disruption from an attack. Available MF AM to PM.","Adopting a Zero Trust security strategy is critical in today’s increasingly complex cybersecurity landscape, especially as organizations move to hybrid work models. This approach operates on the principle that no one and no device should be trusted by default, regardless of whether the request comes from inside or outside the network. Zero Trust mandates continuous verification of all access requests, enforcing least privilege access to ensure users only have access to the resources they absolutely need. This dramatically reduces the attack surface and minimizes the potential impact of a breach.

Additionally, regular cybersecurity training is essential to empower employees in safeguarding the organization’s data. With phishing and social engineering being significant vectors for cyberattacks, it's vital that everyone, not just security professionals, understand how to recognize malicious attempts and protect personal and corporate devices. Phishing simulations can be an effective tool in gauging the success of such training.

Instituting strong cybersecurity processes is another critical element in risk mitigation. Regular patching of both software and hardware reduces vulnerabilities, while clear incident response protocols ensure that teams know exactly what to do when an attack occurs. Utilizing well-established cybersecurity frameworks, such as those from the ISO or NIST, can guide organizations in setting up effective processes that adhere to industry best practices.

Finally, investing in comprehensive cybersecurity solutions is essential. Solutions leveraging AI and automation can detect and respond to attacks in real-time, often without human intervention. Analytics tools that provide a holistic view of an organization’s cybersecurity posture allow teams to identify gaps and areas of concern, ensuring that identities, endpoints, apps, and cloud environments are all adequately protected.

By adopting these strategies and tools, organizations can better protect themselves from the ever-evolving threat landscape.","1. What is the core principle of Zero Trust?

httpswwwpayplugcomblogonline-payment-only-45-of-online-shoppers-know-about-that-sms-authentication-is-soon-coming-to-an-end,"On 14 September, new security/strong authentication standards for online payments came into effect as part of new European regulation (PSD2). The aim is to offer consumers greater protection when buying online. SMS is coming to an end and reinforced authentication (password, biometrics etc.) will now be common for online purchases. To find out more about what cybershoppers think about these changes, we reveal the results of a study by marketing research firm Enov of 1,005 online shoppers. Take a look at our study.

Online shopping: French people are confident but vigilant!

Overall, 92% of people questioned said that they are confident about buying online, even though 67% state that they are vigilant*. Note that the percentage who say that they are completely confident (25%) when buying online falls with the age of the people surveyed, from 32% for 18-34 year olds to just 16% for 55 and overs.

Almost half of cybershoppers (48%) across all ages and genders believe that online shopping is becoming more and more secure. This result should be put into context, as 45% of respondents say that this depends on the website and for 31% it also depends on the country. In fact, 54% of online shoppers feel more exposed to risk when buying online on foreign websites.

Cyberfraud: who's to blame?

Nearly 1 in 5 online shoppers has already been a victim of online fraud (18%).

Even though they are more confident about the security of their online transactions, this phenomenon affects young people more (22%).

70% of fraud victims believe that these incidents are perfectly managed by banks. However, 21% believe that management is good but the process is still cumbersome, and 9% feel that the fraud was not well managed by their bank. 1 in 2 shoppers (51%) believes that in the event of fraud, the responsibility falls solely to the website (51%), while 1 in 3 think that responsibility is shared between the website and the bank. Lastly, 16% think that the bank is solely responsible.

Authentication measures regarded as a security guarantee...

78% of consumers regard authentication stages when buying online as a guarantee of security and safety, while 18% consider it a real hindrance that can put them off making a purchase.

Only 45% of those surveyed state that they have heard about the end of SMS as an authentication solution (while this authentication method is the most widely used today, with 86% of uses**). Notoriety is even lower among 55 and overs: just 35% of them have heard about it.

... but which could be adapted to the amount spent!

Internet users are fairly mixed when it comes to securing online purchases. More than half (57%) believe that this should be proportional to the amount spent: the higher the amount of the transaction, the more secure the transaction should be (including 8% only on the condition that purchases are made regularly on the website).

Of the possible solutions to avoid additional security stages when buying online, cybershoppers will be able to indicate their preferred websites to their bank, which will then be exempt from two-factor authentication. While 31% of those surveyed are in favour of this option, 43% are reluctant; 26% of those questioned agree in principle, provided that this information is not used for commercial purposes.

Securing online purchases: consumers still poorly informed...

41% of people questioned have already heard about two-factor authentication that will now be needed to buy products online. The main sources of information cited are the media (16%), their bank (15%) and e-commerce sites (9%).

16% of online shoppers say that they know some of the criteria that this two-factor authentication could be based on: digital fingerprint (9%), combination of a password and biometric recognition (8%) and facial recognition (7%).

Digital fingerprint: the most popular solution due to its simplicity!

When shoppers were asked about what they think is the simplest solution of the 5 trialled in the study (facial recognition / heart rate / digital fingerprint / retinal scan / password + biometric recognition), digital fingerprint came first (46%), ahead of the combination of password + biometric recognition (31%) and facial recognition (15%).

Lastly, against the backdrop of this new regulation, a certain amount of data has become mandatory for authenticating transactions and improving fraud prevention. Nearly half of those surveyed (48%) are not comfortable with the idea that data about them and their purchases could be sent to the bank via an e-commerce site, while 33% do not consider it a disadvantage if it guarantees their security.

However, although these different biometric recognition solutions may be regarded as simple by some, nearly half of those surveyed (48%) are not comfortable with the idea of this type of information being used for their online transactions (while 33% do not consider it a disadvantage if it guarantees their security).

Take a look at the online study conducted by Enov for Dalenys from 3 to 18 August 2019 of 1,005 online shoppers aged 18 and over.","New security standards for online payments, implemented in September as part of the European regulation PSD2, are aimed at enhancing consumer protection in online shopping. One key change is the end of SMS-based authentication, which will be replaced by more secure methods such as passwords, biometrics, and other forms of reinforced authentication. Despite these changes, many online shoppers are still cautious about online security. A survey revealed that while a majority of consumers feel confident about online shopping, their confidence decreases with age. Younger consumers are more likely to have experienced online fraud, though many believe that banks handle fraud cases well, despite complaints about the process being cumbersome.

The survey also highlighted concerns over the security of online transactions, particularly when shopping on foreign websites, where consumers feel more exposed to risks. There is a divided opinion on who is responsible for fraud, with some believing the website should bear full responsibility, while others think it should be shared between the website and the bank. As part of the new regulations, two-factor authentication (2FA) will become mandatory for online purchases. While some shoppers see this as an added security layer, others find it a hindrance to their shopping experience. The survey shows that more than half of consumers believe the security of a transaction should be proportional to the amount spent.

In terms of biometric authentication, consumers show mixed feelings. While many believe biometric methods like facial recognition and fingerprint scans are simple, there is concern over the privacy implications of sharing such data with banks or e-commerce sites. Almost half of those surveyed are uncomfortable with the idea of having their personal data shared for the purpose of securing transactions. The adoption of these new authentication methods highlights a broader trend toward improving online transaction security while balancing consumer convenience and privacy.","1.

httpswwwprotectukpoliceukthreat-risksecurity-risk-managementrisk-management-process-0,"While its true you're very unlikely to be caught up in a terrorist attack, as an employer, you are required by law to protect employees, customers, volunteers and other people visiting your sites from harm. If you're unfortunate enough to be part of an attack, you need to have a system in place to identify and manage the risks. This will help your organisation to keep people safe and give confidence to those working in or visiting your site by showing that you have taken measures to protect them. This will also reduce the adverse effects that might result from an attack, helping you to protect your reputation or brand and minimise financial losses. This guidance provides information which will help you take forward a strong risk management system which will prepare your organisation to cope better if you should be caught up in an attack. The sections below provide a broad overview of the ProtectUK Risk Management Process and Protect UK Approach, including its supporting resources. The related content page on ProtectUKs Risk Assessment Process will take you through the ProtectUK Approach step-by-step. The ProtectUK Risk Management Process RMP has been tailored specifically to manage terrorist risk. It is adapted from the general risk management process found in a number of standards, including ISOIEC and ISOIEC . The approach consists of five key stages that capture the following core activities The above activities are supported by the ProtectUK risk assessment templates The process of recording and reviewing risks Stages are actively supported by the consistent use of these templates. The related content page on ProtectUKs Risk Assessment process will take you through the ProtectUK Approach step-by-step. The ProtectUK Approach forms the basis of the ProtectUK RMP guidance. It offers a preset approach to assessing terrorist risk that is intended to help familiarise you with how to undertake a risk assessment and how to effectively use the ProtectUK templates. This approach is presented step-by-step to provide you with one example of how a terrorist risk assessment might be undertaken. While the ProtectUK Approach is freely available for use, its primary intention is to act as a broad example to all businesses. In order for you to gain the most value and insight from the risk management process, your risk assessment should be adapted to reflect what is important to your organisation. To support you in achieving this, additional information is provided across this guidance that will help you to understand core risk management concepts, techniques and approaches. This will assist you in tailoring your risk assessment to your organisation in the future. In risk management, a control is any measure or action that modifies risk. In order to address the risk of terrorism, you will need to introduce controls that modify the risk you face to an acceptable level for your organisation. The ProtectUK Controls List has been designed specifically to help you achieve this. The list takes its inspiration from the operational level controls included in ISOIEC , and groups a number of broad counterterrorism related controls across distinct categories The ProtectUK Controls list may be used in conjunction with the enhanced controls captured within the Menu of Tactical Options MoTO to help manage terrorist risk. The Menu of Tactical Options provides a list of prescriptive, enhanced controls that should be considered to support your business when there has been an increase in threat level to critical, or following an incident or attack. These controls may be introduced alongside the controls listed in the ProtectUK Controls List to offer an enhanced response to potential terrorist threats. This may include stepping up the measures you already have in place, or introducing new controls temporarily. The control measures outlined in MoTO are intended for implementation during times of increased risk and may be unsuitable or unsustainable for your organisation in the long term. This is due to the increase in resource and financial commitment that these controls are likely to require. MoTO controls should therefore be subject to informed revision when the threat level decreases. This should be assessed and evaluated using the RMP.","Employers are legally required to protect their employees, customers, and visitors from harm, including the risk of being caught up in a terrorist attack. While the likelihood of such an event is low, having a risk management system in place is essential. This system helps ensure that in the unfortunate event of an attack, the organization is prepared to manage the risks effectively, keeping people safe and minimizing negative impacts.

Key elements of an effective risk management system include:

Identifying and managing risks: This involves assessing potential threats and understanding the risks to your employees and visitors. A proactive approach helps organizations plan responses to emergencies, minimizing harm.

Reputation and financial protection: By showing that you have measures in place to protect people, you instill confidence in employees and customers. Moreover, it helps safeguard your brand and reduces financial losses associated with an attack.

Following guidelines and resources: The ProtectUK Risk Management Process provides a structured approach to building a strong system for dealing with potential attacks. Employers should utilize these resources to understand their obligations and develop comprehensive emergency preparedness plans.

httpswwwreversemodecom202410a-practical-analysis-of-cyber-physicalhtml,"A year ago, shortly after presenting the Chernobyl research, I was kind of surprised to find out that a plethora of brand-new Teleperm XS (2nd generation) components were available on eBay.

Framatome’s Teleperm XS (TXS) is a digital Instrumentation & Control platform designed specifically for use in safety systems in Nuclear power plants, as a replacement for, or upgrades to their analog counterparts. It is one of the most widely used digital safety I&C platforms, sustaining the main defense line (Reactor Protection System, Engineered Safety Features Actuation System) in dozens of nuclear reactors globally, including Europe, USA, Russia, and China.

Obviously, that was a good opportunity to dig deeper into the, usually, closed world of nuclear digital safety I&C systems, so I bought some of the most important TXS modules.

That was the starting point for the research I'm releasing today: ""A Practical Analysis of Cyber-Physical Attacks Against Nuclear Reactors"".

This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive technical analysis of hypothetical cyber-physical attacks targeting the safety systems of nuclear reactors (PWRs), such as the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS).

The paper is structured to facilitate reading and understanding, making this analysis accessible to readers with varying levels of technical expertise.

- The “Introduction” describes the nuclear engineering and nuclear physics concepts behind nuclear fission, Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and NPPs, which are required to follow the subsequent cyber-physical attack scenarios. Prior knowledge of nuclear physics or reactor engineering is not assumed, making it accessible to those without a formal background in these fields.

- “Actors and motivations” describes the background of certain real-world operations involving cyber-physical attacks and nuclear facilities.

- “Teleperm XS” introduces the commercial Instrumentation and Control (I&C) platform, including a detailed description of the hardware, software architecture, attack surface, and eventually those characteristics that could potentially be leveraged by malicious actors.

- “Cyber-Physical Attacks” details an approach to analyzing the design of specific nuclear reactors in order to characterize a series of feasible cyber-physical attacks against their safety systems (e.g. RPS, ESFAS), according to the level of damage sought by the attackers

","The research paper focuses on hypothetical cyberphysical attacks targeting the safety systems of nuclear reactors, specifically the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS).

16. The author's goal is to provide a detailed technical analysis of the vulnerabilities of nuclear reactor safety systems to cyber-physical attacks, raising awareness of these risks and encouraging better security practices within the nuclear industry.
17. Cyber-Physical Attacks are highly relevant in the context of critical infrastructure, as they can lead to significant damage or failures in safety systems, particularly in nuclear reactors.
18. The Teleperm XS platform is significant because it is one of the most widely used digital safety I&C systems in nuclear reactors.
19. The paper is relevant because it addresses a growing concern in the field of nuclear safety: the potential for cyber-physical attacks on critical safety systems.
20. A cyberphysical attack involves manipulating both digital control systems and the physical infrastructure they manage. In nuclear reactors, this could target safety systems like the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS), potentially causing significant damage or accidents.  
21. Cyberphysical attacks exploit vulnerabilities like weak authentication, outdated software, and insecure communication channels. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to control systems and alter reactor settings or disable safety mechanisms.  
22. The Teleperm XS system may be vulnerable due to outdated firmware, insecure protocols, and insufficient security measures in its hardware and software components. Cyberattackers could exploit these weaknesses to manipulate reactor operations.  
23. Cybersecurity in nuclear reactor control systems can be integrated by using encryption, strong access control, intrusion detection systems (IDS), regular software updates, and secure communication protocols to ensure that only authorized users and devices can interact with the systems.  
24. A cyberattack on the RPS could prevent the system from triggering an emergency shutdown during abnormal conditions, potentially leading to unsafe reactor conditions, equipment failure, or even catastrophic events like a nuclear meltdown.  
25. Digital systems increase the risk in safety-critical environments because they provide potential entry points for remote attacks. These systems, if not properly secured, can be exploited by hackers to compromise reactor safety and control systems.  
26. Real-time detection methods include anomaly detection, intrusion detection systems (IDS), continuous monitoring, and security event management (SIEM) systems that alert operators to unusual or malicious activities targeting the safety systems.  
27. Security breaches can be prevented by employing strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, secure network protocols, continuous monitoring, regular patching of software, and providing cybersecurity training for employees.  
28. Encryption protects sensitive communications and data exchange between reactor control components. It ensures that control signals and safety-related information are secure from interception or manipulation by unauthorized actors.  
29. Unauthorized access can be prevented by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and auditing access logs to detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized attempts.  
30. A cyberattack on ESFAS could prevent safety mechanisms like cooling or emergency shutdown systems from activating, potentially leading to a failure in reactor safety systems during emergencies and resulting in unsafe reactor conditions.  
31. The attack surface includes all components that could potentially be targeted by attackers. In nuclear reactor systems, a larger attack surface increases vulnerability to exploitation. Reducing the attack surface minimizes risks by limiting entry points.  
32. Threat modeling helps identify potential attack vectors and weaknesses within the reactor’s digital and physical infrastructure. It allows organizations to implement targeted security controls to protect against specific threats.  
33. Regular security audits help identify vulnerabilities, outdated software, misconfigurations, and areas where security measures can be improved. They ensure that nuclear reactor control systems are protected and compliant with the latest security standards.  
34. Legacy systems like Teleperm XS often lack modern security updates, have limited support for contemporary encryption protocols, and may use outdated communication methods. These characteristics make them more susceptible to cyberattacks, requiring extra measures for cybersecurity.  
35. Firewalls protect reactor communication networks by filtering and monitoring traffic. They block unauthorized access attempts and allow legitimate communication, ensuring that only trusted systems can interact with the reactor’s control systems.  
36. Cyberattack detection systems can be optimized by using advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time anomaly detection, integrating threat intelligence feeds, and ensuring the system can react quickly to detected cyber incidents.  
37. A cyberattack on the communication networks could prevent safe and timely data exchange between safety systems. This delay could lead to inadequate responses to reactor emergencies, potentially escalating the situation.  
38. Securing the physical infrastructure of nuclear reactors involves protecting hardware components from tampering, ensuring system redundancy, and aligning physical security measures with digital cybersecurity protocols to prevent coordinated attacks.  
39. Mitigating cyberphysical attack risks can be done through strong system isolation, using intrusion prevention systems (IPS), conducting regular security assessments, applying timely security patches, and implementing an incident response plan to address potential threats.  
40. Continuous monitoring is essential to detect cyber threats in real-time. It ensures that any suspicious activities or security breaches are identified early, allowing for swift intervention to minimize potential damage to reactor safety systems.  
41. Multi-layered security approaches provide multiple lines of defense. These include firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, access controls, and monitoring systems that work together to protect nuclear reactor safety systems from cyberphysical threats.  
42. Cyberattack simulations, or red team exercises, allow nuclear facilities to test their defenses against simulated attacks. These exercises help identify gaps in cybersecurity measures and improve the readiness of staff and systems to respond to real threats.  
43. System patching is essential in preventing cyberphysical attacks. Regular updates and patches address known vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation and ensuring the security of both software and hardware components in the reactor.  
44. Digital signatures ensure the integrity of communication within reactor control systems. By verifying the authenticity of messages, digital signatures help detect and prevent tampering, ensuring that only authorized changes are made to critical systems.

1 – Singularity AI SIEM Delivers Cloud-Native Detection & Response Across All Data

Security teams are increasingly overwhelmed by the growing volume of data and data sources. This includes everything from network logs and application telemetry to user behavior analytics and external threat intelligence feeds. This increase in data is a double-edged sword: while it provides more insight into potential security risks, it also creates significant challenges for security teams, making it harder to detect real risks amid the noise and manage the sheer volume of information effectively. SentinelOne is reimagining the processes that are foundational to how the security operations center (SOC) work, starting with Singularity AI SIEM.

Powered by the highly-scalable Singularity Data Lake (SDL) with always-on storage, Singularity AI SIEM enables security teams with real-time detection on ingestion, and response capabilities across vast amounts of data, all without the hassle of indexing or managing data storage. SDL leverages the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) to seamlessly integrate with the vast ecosystem of tools required by today’s security teams, providing comprehensive visibility.

AI SIEM accelerates detection, investigation, and response and uses a single platform and console to manage data health, triage threats, and conduct investigations at scale across all data. With the addition of Purple AI, Singularity AI SIEM empowers SOC teams to rapidly automate investigations, reduce alert fatigue, and stay ahead of attacks.

“By consolidating security tools into one platform, SentinelOne has made it very easy for you. Once you have that identification and the detection right away with using AI SIEM and Purple AI, you get an extremely fast investigation all the way up to a remediation.” John McLeod, CISO, NOV

2 – Singularity Hyperautomation Accelerates the SOC for Rapid Response

We’re making response easier than ever with Singularity Hyperautomation. This no-code automation solution will enable SOCs to reduce response times and streamline workflows. Designed to handle the most complex security challenges, Hyperautomation brings out-of-the-box workflows that accelerate detection and response to threats like ransomware. It’s built into the Singularity Platform, not bolted-on, improvising analyst productivity without the complexity.

What sets SentinelOne apart is our seamless integration into the analyst workflow, where automations are intelligently recommended during the investigation process. Coupled with Purple AI, analysts won’t need to manually create playbooks — our platform automatically generates them based on peer-driven insights across our customer community, empowering teams to respond faster and more efficiently.

3 – Focus on the Alerts that Matter with Purple AI Auto-Triage

Alert fatigue is real. The ability to sift through hundreds of alerts to find the few that represent true positives – and equally, the ability to rapidly dismiss false positives and less critical alerts – can mean the difference between risk and a breach. As the attack surface expands and attackers become faster and more sophisticated, this immense pressure facing security teams to prioritize their time is only going to grow.

At OneCon, SentinelOne announced new Alert Auto-Triage capabilities in Purple AI. Designed to automatically assess, triage, and prioritize alerts to help security teams focus on those requiring immediate investigation. Auto-Triage will harness new AI-powered Global Alert Analysis, amplifying the wisdom of our expert security community to assess thousands of anonymized similar alerts and help SOC teams more accurately determine alert verdicts. The Alerts to Investigate dashboard view and alert table filter help analysts focus on the most relevant alerts.

Another key capability powering Auto-Alert Triage is Community Verdict, which displays the proportion of similar alerts flagged as true positives by Known Expert Votes that carry more weight. Similarly, Verdicts to Review notifies users when their recent verdicts contradicts the latest Community Verdict consensus, prompting an opportunity to re-review their assumptions with additional information. Altogether, Purple AI Auto-Triage aims to empower security teams to minimize their rate of false positives, reduce alert fatigue, and quickly surface real threats that require immediate attention.

4 – Purple AI Auto-Investigations Reduce Hours to Minutes

Investigations are hours-long arduous tasks for SOC analysts, but with Purple AI Auto-Investigations, the entire process will be streamlined up to even minutes. At OneCon, SentinelOne announced Purple AI Auto-Investigations, a powerful new feature designed to automate the complex and time-consuming process of security investigations. This will not only save time, but also level up efficiency by automating investigation steps, gathering evidence, and documenting everything in an auditable, human-readable notebook for review.

With Auto-Investigations, Purple AI will automatically create a detailed investigation plan broken down into specific, concrete steps. Security analysts will have the flexibility to either execute these investigative steps themselves or have Purple AI automatically run on their behalf. As the investigation progresses, all evidence gathered during these steps is systematically collected and summarized in an auditable notebook, creating a clear record of the investigation process giving security teams the efficiency they need to address critical threats quickly.

One of the most innovative aspects of the feature is how it executes investigation steps during off-hours. While analysts are asleep, Purple AI is automating the work by identifying next steps in real-time, gathering evidence, and analyzing information so that investigations continue around the clock.

5 – Introducing Ultraviolet, SentinelOne’s Family of Security Models

The generative AI landscape has evolved, making general LLMs more affordable and capable for cybersecurity tasks when paired with human expertise, while specialized models remain essential for handling security-specific needs. Combining both types of models provides a comprehensive, “better-together” approach to creating effective AI security assistants.

This is exactly what the introduction of SentinelOne’s Ultraviolet family of security models is built to achieve. Introduced at OneCon – and powering SentinelOne’s Purple AI security analyst – these new models are designed to address scenarios that fall outside of what’s possible with general purpose models alone, such as improving detection efficacy by considering more context in real-time to enable more efficient reasoning behind security issues. Ultraviolet’s family of security LLMs and multimodal models are designed to address specific use cases, significantly cutting down operation burdens on security teams. This focus on specialized use cases results in a greater amount of autonomy since these models are fine-tuned to stay on task and require substantially fewer tokens to reach actionable conclusions.

httpswwwwelivesecuritycomenbusiness-securitybeyond-checkbox-demystifying-cybersecurity-compliance,"In an era of escalating digital threats, cybersecurity compliance goes beyond ticking a legal box – it’s a crucial shield safeguarding assets, reputation, and the very survival of your business

What is the most common pain point facing businesses these days? Is it supply chain fragility? Fierce competition? Tight cashflows? Or is it the rising and relentless tide of cyberattacks?

Evidence and analysts suggest it’s often the latter. As cyberthreats show no signs of slowing down, both small and large organizations increasingly recognize that cybersecurity is no longer optional.

What’s more, governments and regulatory agencies have also caught onto its importance, especially when it concerns organizations that operate in sectors that are critical to a nation’s national infrastructure. The result? An expanding set of compliance requirements that feel daunting but are essential for a country’s smooth operations and public security.

Forms of compliance

For starters, we need to distinguish between two types of compliance – compulsory and voluntary, as each brings its own set of requirements.

Compulsory compliance encompasses regulations enforced by state-level or state-adjacent agencies and targeting companies operating in critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare, transport, and energy. For example, a company working with patient data in the US must abide by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a federal regulation, to maintain patient data privacy across state lines.

On the other hand, voluntary compliance means that businesses apply for specific certifications and standards that identify them as experts within a particular field or qualify some of their products as fulfilling a standard. For example, a company seeking environmental credibility might apply for ISO 14001 certification that demonstrates its commitment to environment-friendly practices.

However, every company needs to recognize that compliance isn’t a one-time effort. Every standard, or another “bit of compliance”, requires additional resources since these processes require consistent monitoring and budget allocations (even ISO certifications require regular re-certification).

Cybersecurity compliance – not only for security vendors

A company that doesn’t conform to compulsory compliance can face hefty fines. Incidents such as data breaches or ransomware attacks can result in extensive costs, but evidence of a failure to comply with mandated security measures can ultimately cause the final bill to go “through the roof”.

The specific cybersecurity regulations an organization needs to abide by depend on the type of industry the company operates in, and how important the security of its internal data is to privacy, data security, or critical infrastructure acts. Do also note that many regulatory acts and certifications are region-specific.

Furthermore, depending on what customers, clients, or partners a business wants to attract, it is wise to apply for a specific certificate to qualify for a contract. For example, if a company wants to work with the US federal government, it needs to apply for the FedRAMP certificate, demonstrating its competence in protecting federal data.

At any rate, compliance needs to be built into the foundations of any business strategy. As regulatory requirements keep rising in the future, well-prepared companies will have an easier time adapting to the changes, With compliance being measured continuously, this can save organizations significant resources and enable their growth in the long run.

Key cybersecurity acts and frameworks

Let’s now have a quick rundown on some of the most important cybersecurity regulatory acts and frameworks:

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

This regulatory act covers the handling of patient information in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. It represents a set of standards that are designed to protect confidential patient health data from being misused, requiring administrative entities to enact various safeguards to protect said data, both physically and electronically.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks

A US government agency under the Department of Commerce, NIST develops standards and guidelines for various sectors, including cybersecurity. By mandating a certain set of policies that serve as the foundation of organizational security, it enables businesses and industries to better manage their cybersecurity. For example, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 contains comprehensive guidance for organizations of all sizes and current security posture on how they can manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI DSS is another information security standard designed to control credit card data handling. Its goal is to reduce payment fraud risks by tightening the security surrounding cardholder data. It applies to all entities that handle card data, be it a store, a bank, or a service provider.

Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2)

This directive strengthens the cyber-resilience of critical entities in the European Union by imposing stricter security requirements and risk management practices on entities operating in sectors such as energy, transport, health, digital services and managed security services. NIS2 also introduces new incident reporting rules and fines for non-compliance.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The GDPR is one of the strictest data privacy and security regulations globally. It focuses on the privacy and data privacy rights of people in the European Union, giving them control over their data and mandating secure storage and breach reporting for companies that manage the data.

There are both industry-specific and broad regulatory frameworks, and each comes with unique requirements. Complying with one doesn’t guarantee that you’re not in breach of another set of rules; therefore, pay attention to which regulations apply to your business and its operations.

Costly non-compliance

What about non-compliance? As mentioned previously, certain regulations institute hefty penalties.

For example, GDPR violations may result in fines of up to 10 million euros, or 2% of global annual turnover, for any company that fails to notify either a supervisory authority or the data subjects of a breach. Supervisory authorities can also slap additional fines for inadequate security measures, leading to further costs.

In the US, non-compliance with FISMA, for example, can mean reduced federal funding, government hearings, censure, lost future contracts, and more. Similarly, HIPAA violations could also have some dire consequences, be they US$1.5 million worth of fines annually and even jail time of 10 years. Clearly, there is more at stake than financial well-being.

All in all, it is better to be safe than sorry, and it’s also prudent to keep up with cybersecurity regulations specific to your industry. Rather than viewing it as an additional avoidable expense, your business should see compliance as an essential and regular investment, doubly so in the case of compulsory standards, which, if neglected, could quickly turn your business, if not life, upside down.","In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity compliance is a vital defense against the increasing number of cyberattacks, which pose a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. As cyber threats continue to grow, organizations must recognize that cybersecurity is no longer optional. Governments and regulatory bodies have expanded compliance requirements, especially for companies operating in critical infrastructure sectors like healthcare, transport, and energy. These regulations are designed to safeguard national security and public safety, and businesses must comply to avoid significant fines and penalties.

Compliance is divided into compulsory and voluntary categories. Compulsory compliance refers to regulations enforced by state or governmental agencies, such as HIPAA for healthcare data privacy or PCI DSS for handling credit card data. Voluntary compliance involves certifications, like ISO, that demonstrate a company's commitment to security standards. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in severe financial repercussions, including hefty fines, loss of contracts, or even jail time for executives. For instance, GDPR violations can lead to fines of up to millions of euros, and HIPAA violations can result in fines and criminal penalties.

To manage these risks, businesses must integrate compliance into their core strategies and continuously monitor their cybersecurity practices. Important frameworks and regulations like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the EU's NIS Directive, and GDPR offer guidelines for improving security posture and reducing risks. Additionally, regulatory bodies now require incident reporting and impose fines for noncompliance, reinforcing the importance of adhering to cybersecurity standards. Failure to comply not only leads to financial loss but can also severely damage a company's reputation and future prospects. Therefore, businesses should view cybersecurity compliance as an ongoing investment rather than an avoidable expense.","1.

httpswwwwelivesecuritycomencybercrimedont-become-statistic-defending-data-dark-web,"You may not always stop your personal information from ending up in the internet’s dark recesses, but you can take steps to protect yourself from criminals looking to exploit it

How did 44% members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and 68% of British MPs let their personal details end up circulating on the dark web? The answer is simpler and possibly more alarming than you may think: many will have signed up to online accounts using their official email address, and entered additional personally identifiable information (PII). They will then have been helpless as that third-party provider was breached by cybercriminals, who subsequently shared or sold the data to other threat actors on the dark web.

Unfortunately, this is not something confined to politicians or others in the public eye and it’s not the only way one’s data can end up in the internet’s seedy underbelly. It could happen to anyone – possibly even when they do everything correctly. And frequently, it does happen. That’s why it pays to keep a closer eye on your digital footprint and the data that matters most to you.

The dark web is thriving

First things first: Contrary to popular assumption, the dark web is not illegal and it’s not populated solely by cybercriminals. It merely refers to parts of the internet that aren’t indexed by traditional search engines: a place where users can roam anonymously using Tor Browser.

However, it’s also true to say that today’s cybercrime economy has been built on a thriving dark web, with many of the dedicated forums and marketplaces visited by cybercriminals in their droves while being hidden from law enforcement. (That said, some of the nefarious activities have increasingly been spilling onto well-known social media platforms in recent years.)

As an enabler for a criminal economy worth trillions, the dark web sites allow threat actors to buy and sell stolen data, hacking tools, DIY guides, service-based offerings and much more – with impunity. Despite periodic crackdowns by law enforcement, these sites continue to adapt, with new platforms emerging to fill the gaps left as previous incumbents are dismantled by the authorities.

When Proton and Constella Intelligence researchers went looking, they found that a staggering two-fifths (40%) of British, European and French parliamentarians’ email addresses were exposed on the dark web. That’s nearly 1,000 out of a possible 2,280 emails. Even worse, 700 of these emails had passwords associated with them stored in plain text and exposed on dark web sites. When combined with other exposed information including dates of birth, home addresses, and social media account handles, they provide a treasure trove of identity data that can be used in follow-on phishing attacks and identity fraud.

How does my data end up on the dark web?

There are various ways your own data could end up in a dark web forum or site. Some may be the result of negligence while many others are not. Consider the following:

Data breaches at third-party organizations: Your data is stolen from an organization you have done business with, and which has collected your data, in the past. In the US, 2023 was a record year for data compromises of this type: More than 3,200 incidents at organizations led to the compromise of data belonging to over 353 million customers.

In the US, 2023 was a record year for data compromises of this type: More than 3,200 incidents at organizations led to the compromise of data belonging to over 353 million customers. Phishing attacks: One of your online accounts (e.g., email, bank, social media) is compromised via a phishing attack. A legitimate-looking email, direct message, text or WhatsApp contains a link which may install info-stealing malware or trick you into entering your personal and/or log-in details (i.e., a spoofed login page for Microsoft 365).

A legitimate-looking email, direct message, text or WhatsApp contains a link which may install info-stealing malware or trick you into entering your personal and/or log-in details (i.e., a spoofed login page for Microsoft 365). Credential stuffing: An online account is compromised via a brute-force attack. (credential stuffing, dictionary attack, etc.) where hackers guess your password or use previously breached logins across other sites. Once inside your account, they steal more personal information stored in there to sell or use.

Once inside your account, they steal more personal information stored in there to sell or use. Info-stealing malware: Your personal data is stolen via information-stealing malware that could be hidden in legitimate-looking apps and files for download (such as pirated movies/games), phishing attachments, malicious ads, websites etc.

Figure 2. PayPal and credit card accounts up for grabs, as spotted by ESET researchers

However the bad guys get hold of your data, once it’s shared on a dark web cybercrime site it could then be given away or sold to the highest bidder. Depending on the type of data, whomever gets hold of it will likely use those logins and PII to:

Hijack your bank accounts to steal more information including bank/card details.

Design more convincing phishing messages which share some of the stolen PII in a bid to persuade you to hand over more.

Steal your email or social media accounts to spam friends and address book contacts with malicious links.

Commit identity fraud; e.g., taking out new lines of credit in your name, generating false tax returns in order to receive a refund, or illegally receiving medical services.

Figure 3. Cybercriminals explaining things step by step

How do I check?

If you’re signed up to an identity protection or dark web monitoring service, it should flag any PII or other data it finds on the dark web. Tech companies, including Google and Mozilla, will also alert you when a saved password has been found in a data breach, or may require updating to a more secure, harder-to-guess version.

Importantly, dark web monitoring is often also part of a range of services provided by security vendors, whose products obviously come with many other benefits and are a critical component of your personal security stack.

Alternatively, you could proactively visit a site like HaveIBeenPwned, which has compiled large lists of breached email addresses and passwords that can be securely queried.

What do I do if my data has been stolen?

If the worst happens and, like a British politician, you find your data has been exposed and is being traded on the dark web, what happens next? In the short term, consider taking emergency steps such as:

Change all your passwords, especially the affected ones, to strong, unique credentials

Use a password manager to store and recall your saved passwords and passphrases

Switch on two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts that offer it

Notify the relevant authorities (law enforcement, social media platform, etc.)

Ensure all of your computers and devices have security software installed from a reputable vendor.

Freeze your bank accounts (if relevant) and ask for new cards. Monitor them for any unusual purchases.

Look out for other unusual activity on accounts such as being unable to login, changes to security settings, messages/updates from accounts you don’t recognize or logins from strange locations and strange times.

Staying safe in the long-term

To avoid being hit in the future, consider:

Being more wary of oversharing information online.

Revisiting the security/privacy settings of your social media accounts.

Turning on ‘stealth mode’; i.e., when appropriate, use options such as disposable email addresses so you don’t always have to give away your personal details.

Never replying to unsolicited emails, messages or calls – especially those that try to hurry you into taking action without thinking clearly first.

Use strong and unique passwords on all accounts that offer it and enable a strong form of 2FA for added protection.

Investing in a dark web monitoring service that will alert you to newly-found personal details in the internet’s seedy underbelly and potentially enable you to take action before cybercriminals can monetize the data.

It’s not much fun having your personal information and/or identity stolen. It can be a traumatic, stressful experience which may last weeks or months before a resolution.
